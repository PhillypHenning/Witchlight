## Event History

### Pre-Campaign
- Father died, sold lute to pay debts
- Mother dated his bully
- Fled village after failed musical attempts
- Made pact with Mr. Hat (soul for "home")
- **Sold soul to Chopaign** (archdevil/pit fiend)
- Met and befriended Di (who later tried to save him)
- Traveled to help old friend Madryck

### Arc 1: Witchlight Carnival
- [ATTENTION:DM - Specific Arc 1 events not detailed in notes]

### Arc 2: Hither
- Encountered brigands
- Met Hans the Stork
- Helped confront Bavlorna
- Made deals that would come back to haunt him

### Arc 3: Downfall - The Accidental God-King
- **Entered Downfall**: Frog people domain where titles are won by killing the previous holder
- **Killed the King**: Inadvertently became King of Downfall
- **The Rot Worm Pit Incident**: 
  - Party climbed stairs and bunkered down in bathroom around the corner
  - Friends left Sevro in a pit of rot worms
  - Sevro climbed out broken and confused during the night
  - Yanaba heard his sobbing but left him (she didn't like him much)
  - Party found him in the morning
  - This betrayal marked a turning point in Sevro's terrible luck
- **Frog Army Attack**: After Sevro left, entire frog army pursued them
  - Drove the group into "the space between spaces"
- **Collective Belief Makes Reality**: In Downfall, what the frog people collectively believe becomes real
- **Became a Minor God**: 
  - The frogs began believing Sevro was a malevolent god who disrupted their "perfect harmony" (of killing each other)
  - This collective belief made it reality
  - Sevro is now effectively a minor god
  - He is King of Downfall whether he wants to be or not
- **Terrible Luck Curse**: 
  - **The godhood itself marked Sevro with terrible luck**
  - Since becoming a god, if something bad can happen to Sevro, it will
  - Became a "punching bag for unluck"
  - Everything that can go wrong does go wrong
  - The rot worm pit incident was traumatic, but the unluck is tied to his divine status

### Arc 4: Twilight Court & Soul Crisis
- **Soul Court Trial** - Barnabas held court to determine soul ownership
  - **Claimants**: Chopaign (contract) and Mr. Hat (verbal agreement)
  - **Mr. Hat's claim**: Verbal agreement where Sevro offered "home" in exchange for soul
  - **Chopaign's claim**: Signed contract (soul sold)
  - **VERDICT**:
    - Mr. Hat gets rights to torment Sevro's soul for first **1000 years** of afterlife
    - Chopaign gets all rights after 1000 years for **rest of eternity**
    - Chopaign gets **bi-weekly weekend visitation** during Mr. Hat's period
  - Sevro declared it "completely unacceptable"
  - **Kagg's Attack**: Immediately after trial, frog knight Kagg struck Sevro with lightning bolt
    - Sevro **killed instantly but revived**
    - Sevro shot Kagg with crossbow (critical damage)
    - Di and Karag attacked, Kagg died
  - Chopaign was disappointed Kagg didn't kill Sevro
  - Sevro considered shooting Barnabas but chose not to (earned inspiration)
- Baba Yaga addressed him as "Sevro, the thief king"

### Arc 5: Thither
- **Session 1**: Storm appears overhead when Sevro is emotional (beacon in Feywild)
- **Session 2**:
  - Attempted to cook disgusting stew (rocks, dirt) trying to taste something - no success
  - Grabbed all casino invitations and stuffed them in pants
  - Mentioned being married to "Nuff" to bugbear guards (Nuff's cousin)
  - Shopping at Martin's (bought items)
  - Charged at Shako the clown demanding information
  - Heading toward casino
- **Session 4**:
  - Stravens: started ~100, ended with 60 before cashing out → **-5 INT** (5 stravens remaining)
  - Went upstairs with two escorts; was handed a **Potion of Alter Self** on the way up (escorts needed him "bearable to be around" — he normally looks like a corpse). Drank it immediately — appeared whole/living, felt nothing physically; internally frustrated it had no effect on him.
  - Payment dispute with escorts over fee (12 stravens total); refused to pay; **Gorthax arrived, punched Sevro with brass knuckles, broke his nose, knocked him down, took 15 stravens** (12 to escorts, 3 for himself)
  - **White Bliss drug was NOT offered** — that hook is still pending for a future session
  - Left the casino furious; wants to "torch the whole place" / burn down the spa
  - Offered his remaining 50 stravens to Di — refused by casino rule (no chip transfers between players)
  - Attempted to make breakfast at camp: completely burned/charred; cotton candy caramelized black
  - Tried to address Di by name; **could not remember Di's name** — called him "turtle guy" / "reptilian"
  - Party gave Di the temporary name "Patunia" / "Pete"
  - **CLIFFHANGER**: Four figures approaching from the south toward Sevro at camp (frog knight ambush?)

- **Session 3**:
  - Fed pale fruit by Yanaba - nothing happened (face expressionless effect?)
  - **Did not take cover** during Raining Cats and Dogs encounter
  - Failed Dex save: Ran over, bitten, clawed - had a bad time
  - Passed casino security check (no devil association flagged)
  - Took position at bar with Karag and Seren
  - **Tried to join Caldrien's upstairs orgy invitation**
  - **Completely ignored by Caldrien** (new established trait: Caldrien only interacts with "ugly" people)
  - Started with 100 starven buy-in
  - Losses unknown by session end

### Upcoming Threats
- **3-Way Ambush (Session 4 Cliffhanger)**: A Knight + Squire from Downfall will attack Sevro (revenge for killing Kagg; claim his crown) — see [3-Way-Ambush.md](../Arcs/Arc_5_Thither/3-Way-Ambush.md)
- **White Bliss** drug will be offered by casino escort (addiction risk)

## DM Notes & Hooks

### Active Plot Threads
1. **King of Downfall**: Frog knights seek to kill him and claim the crown
2. **Minor Godhood**: Sevro is a god due to collective frog belief (source of terrible luck)
3. **Bavlorna Unaware**: The hag doesn't know about Sevro's godhood status
4. **Soul Ownership**: Split between Mr. Hat (1000 years) and Chopaign (eternity)
5. **Chopaign's Cruel Plan**: Will send Di/party to fetch father's soul from rival, then force Sevro to choose who suffers (unknown to Sevro/Di)
6. **Chopaign's Disappointment**: Patron wanted Sevro dead, may try again
7. **Frog Knight Revenge**: Knights come to kill the "mad tyrant" and claim kingship
8. **Terrible Luck Curse**: Godhood marked him with unluck - everything goes wrong
9. **Loss of Taste**: Cannot taste anything, desperately trying to fix it
10. **Father's Lute**: Sold to pay debts, possible quest to reclaim
11. **Madryck**: Old friend connection, what's owed?
12. **Music**: When will he play again? What will move him?
13. **Caldrien's Rejection**: "Beautiful people" don't interest the incubus owner

### Chopaign's Hidden Plan
**Sevro and Di are unaware of this:**
- Sevro's father's soul is held by a **rival archdevil** (identity unknown)
- Chopaign plans to send **Di and the party** to retrieve the father's soul
- Will give them **Scrolls of Return** to bring them back to his sitting room
- Once Chopaign has the soul, he'll present Sevro with an impossible choice:
  - Continue suffering his current fate (Mr. Hat then Chopaign)
  - OR offer up his father's soul to suffer in his place
- **The real goal**: The strife and grief this causes Sevro is what Chopaign truly wants
- Either choice leads to Sevro's emotional torment
- This is pure cruelty disguised as mercy

### Future Considerations
- White bliss drug addiction potential (Constitution save DC 15)
- Storm beacon makes him trackable - who else is watching?
- What does Mr. Hat want? (bi-weekly visits from Chopaign)
- Can his soul contracts be broken or renegotiated?
- Will he reclaim his father's lute?
- What truly moves him to play music now?
- What will Sevro choose when he learns Chopaign's plan? Father vs. self?

### Travis's Play Style
- [ATTENTION:DM - Player preferences and tendencies not noted]
- Appears as "jink" in some session transcripts

### Baba Yaga's Title
- Called him "the thief king" - likely referring to stealing the Downfall crown
- May also reference the invitations he constantly steals/hoards
- Baba Yaga knows about his god-king status

## DM Notes & Hooks

### Active Plot Threads
1. **Soul Ownership**: Split between Mr. Hat (1000 years) and Chopaign (eternity)
2. **Chopaign's Disappointment**: Patron wanted Sevro dead, may try again
3. **Frog Knight Revenge**: Another knight coming with archers in 4-Way Ambush
4. **Loss of Taste**: Cannot taste anything, desperately trying to fix it
5. **Father's Lute**: Sold to pay debts, possible quest to reclaim
6. **Madryck**: Old friend connection, what's owed?
7. **Music**: When will he play again? What will move him?
8. **Caldrien's Rejection**: "Beautiful people" don't interest the incubus owner

### Future Considerations
- White bliss drug addiction potential (Constitution save DC 15)
- Storm beacon makes him trackable - who else is watching?
- What does Mr. Hat want? (bi-weekly visits from Chopaign)
- Can his soul contracts be broken or renegotiated?
- Will he reclaim his father's lute?
- What truly moves him to play music now?

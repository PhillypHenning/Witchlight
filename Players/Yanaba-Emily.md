## DM Notes & Hooks

1. **Birth Parents**: Imprisoned in Cinder Hold Prison under Skabatha
2. **Kidnapping Threat**: Skabatha knows about her, kidnappers coming in 4-Way Ambush
3. **Star the Kitten**: Promised Dirlagraun to find the missing displacer kitten
4. **Identity Crisis**: Swapped at birth, true Feywild origins vs. human upbringing
5. **Di's Secret**: Only party member who knows about Velisara contract

### Future Considerations
- How will she react to learning about birth parents?
- What's her relationship with adoptive parents now?
- Will she be captured in the 4-Way Ambush?
- How does she balance loyalty to adoptive family vs. birth family?
- What role does her Feywild nature play in Thither?

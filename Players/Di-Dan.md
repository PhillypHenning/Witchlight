## Background

### Original Path - Cleric Training
- Originally trained as a cleric
- [ATTENTION:DM - Which deity? What order?]
- [ATTENTION:DM - How far in training? Fully ordained or student?]

### The Desperate Pact
- Made a **desperate pact with pit fiend Chopaign** to save his friend Sevro's soul
- **Under false pretenses**: Claimed to be selling his own cleric soul
- Actually became a warlock bound to one of the most powerful entities in the Nine Hells
- The pact didn't save Sevro—just entangled Di in the same infernal web

### False Identity
- **Party may not know he's a warlock**
- Poses as a cleric to party
- Uses warlock powers while maintaining cleric facade
- [ATTENTION:DM - Do any party members know the truth?]

---

## Motivations

### Primary Goals
- Save Sevro from eternal damnation (original goal, may be complicated now)
- Navigate his patron relationship without losing himself
- Maintain his cover as a cleric
- [ATTENTION:DM - Does he want to break free of Chopaign? Or learn to work with him?]

### Personal Drives
- Loyalty to Sevro (willing to sacrifice soul for friend)
- [ATTENTION:DM - Relationship with his cleric faith now? Conflicted?]
- Survival in a deal with one of the Six Night Shades
- Proving himself to Chopaign (patron expects results)

### Fears & Struggles
- Chopaign discovering his weakness/failures
- Party discovering he's a warlock not a cleric
- Unable to save Sevro despite sacrifice
- Becoming a tool of the Nine Hells
- Losing his identity/soul completely

---

## Event History

### Pre-Campaign
- Trained as a cleric
- Befriended Sevro
- Learned of Sevro's soul contracts
- Made desperate pact with Chopaign under false pretenses
- Became warlock while pretending to remain cleric
- Received molten scimitar from patron

### Arc 1-3: [ATTENTION:DM - Early campaign events not detailed in notes]

### Arc 4: Twilight Court & Soul Crisis
- **Sevro's Soul Court**: Present during trial
  - Witnessed verdict: Mr. Hat gets 1000 years, then Chopaign gets eternity
  - **Chopaign appeared and criticized Di**: "Not being strong enough after receiving power"
  - **Di's scimitar became "absolutely molten"**: Red/black snake eye visible in jewel during trial
  - Witnessed Kagg attack Sevro
  - Di attacked Kagg with opportunity attacks (helped kill him)
- Baba Yaga addressed him as "Di the soul-seller"
- [ATTENTION:DM - Met Chopaign directly? Or just manifestation through scimitar?]

### Arc 5: Thither
- **Session 2**:
  - Sold blue flame torch for 9 gold to Martin
  - Offered to repair shabby Witchlight wings for 10 gold
  - Martin agreed to pass Di's name to Mr. Witch for future repair work
  - Traded random unidentified key for vague casino directions from Shako
  - Di's scroll crafting advanced one day
- **Session 4**:
  - Stravens: started ~30, ended with 0 after cashing out → **+3 CON** (Constitution now has +2 modifier)
  - Sold scroll of blindness/deafness for 12 stravens (worth 25 — got ripped off by prize goblins)
  - Traded a 1st-level scroll for 2 stravens + a **wad of gum** (1 year of goblin gum collection, smells awful)
  - Lost 2 stravens at Wheel of Want betting on even (landed odd)
  - **Skabatha revealed to have a crush on Chopaign** — told privately by DM (Skabatha is Witch of Games who owns Thither; Chopaign from deeper Hells / "Memphis")
  - **Party forgot Di's name** — woke up unable to remember it; Di temporarily named "Patunia" / "Pete"; Di felt oddly free about it; possible Yarnspinner/Fablerise curse (Forgotten Names)
  - Left casino; party heading toward Never Leave Spa
  - **CLIFFHANGER**: Camp surrounded — four cloaked figures heading toward Karag from the west; four figures from the south toward Sevro; two pairs of yellow eyes to the east

- **Session 3**:
  - **Initial buy-in: 20 starvens** (20 ability score points)
  - **Flagged by casino security**: Enchanted detection stone identified Di as associated with another devil
  - **Doors closed**, shutting Di out from rest of group
  - Yanaba stayed back, hanging around door
  - **Interrogated by Head of Security (Gorthax)** about devil association
  
  - **VELISARA'S CONTRACT** (witnessed by Yanaba, hidden):
    - Velisara (succubus owner) entered security hallway
    - Made Di an offer: Information about Chopaign for Chopaign's true eye color
    - **Terms**: Provide Chopaign's true eye color within 2 months OR owe 100 starvens immediately
    - **Di signed the agreement**
    - Velisara provided information about Chopaign:
      - Where he resides
      - How powerful he is  
      - Details about his domain and operations
    - **CRITICAL MISTAKE**: Di never asked who Velisara and Caldrien's boss is
  
  - Security cleared Di, he entered casino
  - Played table games, taking heavy losses
  - **Lost all 20 starvens** of initial buy-in
  
  - **CALDRIEN'S CONTRACT**:
    - After Di busted out, Caldrien (incubus owner) approached
    - Offered Di **50 starvens** to sign the same contract Velisara offered
    - Provide Chopaign's true eye color within 2 months OR owe 100 starvens
    - **Di signed again**
    - **What Di doesn't know**: Velisara and Caldrien work together—same contract, not two separate deals

### Chopaign's Pending Response
**When Di asks Chopaign about his eye color** (hasn't happened yet):
- Chopaign will **catch on immediately** to why Di is asking
- Will **scold Di** for making deals with devils without learning who they serve
- Will compare casino owners' boss's power to his own (subtly, not obvious to Di)
- **Counter-deal**: Find the casino owners' **boss's name** OR the owners' **true names** (Velisara and Caldrien's real infernal names)
- **Only then** will Chopaign provide his eye color
- May send his own investigator to learn about casino owners

## DM Notes & Hooks

### Active Plot Threads
1. **Casino Contract**: Must provide Chopaign's eye color in 2 months or owe 100 starvens
2. **Chopaign's Test**: When Di asks about eye color, Chopaign will demand casino owners' boss name or their true names first
3. **False Identity**: Party may not know he's a warlock
4. **Chopaign's Criticism**: Patron disappointed in Di's weakness/lack of progress
5. **Mission from Chopaign**: Encouraged to kill Hourglass Coven witches and locate Skabatha's lair
6. **Sevro's Soul**: Original motivation still unresolved
7. **Yanaba Knows**: She witnessed Velisara contract—will she tell others?

### Chopaign - The Night Shade
- **One of the Six Night Shades of Cania**: Elite pit fiends in Mephistopheles's domain
- **Operates in Mephistar**: 8th Layer of the Nine Hells
- Among the most powerful fiends in infernal hierarchy
- Master of contracts, souls, and infernal politics
- Has spy networks across planes
- **Mysterious interest** in Prismeer/Hourglass Coven
- **Expects bi-weekly reports** from Di

### Casino Situation Complications
- **Velisara and Caldrien work together**: Di doesn't know this
- **They want information on Chopaign**: Eye color is "truth" with power in Nine Hells
- **They have a boss**: Someone comparable to Chopaign in power
- **Di failed to ask critical questions**: Who do they serve? Why do they want this?
- **Chopaign's counter-demand**: Forces Di into infernal espionage
- **2-month deadline**: Time pressure building

### Future Considerations
- When will Di ask Chopaign about eye color?
- How will Di learn casino owners' boss name or true names?
- Will Chopaign's investigator appear?
- What happens if Di fails the contract?
- Will party learn he's a warlock?
- Can he reconcile cleric training with warlock pact?
- What does Chopaign ultimately want in Prismeer?

### Dan's Play Style
- [ATTENTION:DM - Player preferences and tendencies not noted]

### Ability Score Tracking
- [ATTENTION:DM - URGENT: Need to determine which 20 ability score points Di lost at casino]
- Track carefully for mechanical impact

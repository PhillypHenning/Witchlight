## Background

### Orc Heritage & Rejection
- "Home" is not a concept known to half-orcs
- Cast out from Orc society at a young age after his father's death
- The Eyes of Gruumsh thought him **weak, defiled by human blood**
- **Seems to be ashamed of his orc heritage**

### Wandering Years - Cold and Hungry
- Wandered along the roads of the north with no destination
- Food was scarce
- Taught to fight with sword and shield but useless with bow (couldn't hunt)
- Provided menial labor for those who would accept it
- Humans, elves, and dwarves placed no trust in him out of fear
- Recognized as strong and capable but mistrusted for being part-orc
- **At night, plagued by a single burning eye calling him to show them why he should be feared** (Gruumsh's influence)

### The Blizzard & The Priest
**In the depths of winter**, a blizzard caught Karag far from civilization:
- Took shelter in a nearby cave
- Found a fire burning, meat roasting—intoxicating smell
- Hadn't eaten for at least a day
- Approached to steal food, then a stern but calm voice called out:
  - **"I'm willing to share, you need only ask."**
- A man in brown robes emerged from darkness
- **The kindness was foreign to Karag** (suspected trick)

**The Priest's Offer**:
- Priest was paying respects to his god (Grumbar) before retiring
- Invited Karag to sit by fire and share meal
- Told his story: Traveling south to temple dedicated to **Grumbar, the earth god**
- **Grumbar is unshakeable and unchanging, like the very ground on which we stand**
- Asked about Karag's plans: "Plans? I've never had any plans that go beyond making it through the night."
- **Offered Karag work**: "I could use some protection, you look intimidating enough. And you would be compensated well."

### Finding Purpose - The Temple
- Traveled with priest to **temple hewn from sheer cliff face**
- Met other members of Grumbar's order: priests, monks, druids, clerics
- They were dedicated to keeping the firm and unchanging tenets of Grumbar
- **First sense of stability in Karag's life**
- Made decision to join the order
- Took **"The Oath of Landwalking"**
- Joined the **Order of Sardonyx Knights** as holy protector
- Fights against radical and unchecked chaos

---

## Motivations

### Primary Goals
- Uphold the Oath of Landwalking and serve Grumbar
- Protect the tenets of stability and order
- Fight radical and unchecked chaos
- [ATTENTION:DM - Reconcile "Heir of Twilight" with Grumbar worship?]
- [ATTENTION:DM - Understand what "Heir of Twilight" means for his destiny]

### Personal Drives
- Find belonging after lifetime of rejection
- Prove worth beyond orc heritage
- Maintain stability he finally found
- [ATTENTION:DM - Escape/accept the "burning eye" at night? Gruumsh's call?]

### Internal Conflicts
- **Karag's Dream (Upcoming)**: Three paths vision
  1. **Fury** (Bavlorna's curse - rage and becoming the monster)
  2. **Stillness** (Grumbar's oaths - mountain's steadfastness)
  3. **The Throne** (Fighter path - Heir of Twilight, sovereignty)
- Philosophical questions: "Why are these my choices? Why must I follow these? Who decides what I become?"

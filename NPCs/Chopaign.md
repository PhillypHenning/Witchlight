# Chopaign - The Archdevil Patron

## Overview
Chopaign is an archdevil who serves as patron to both Sevro and Di, though under vastly different circumstances. He is calculating, manipulative, and operates with the long-term scheming typical of infernal powers.

## Appearance
[To be detailed during gameplay]

## Power Level
- Powerful enough to be compared to whoever commands the Starved Goblin Casino owners (Velisara and Caldrien)
- The true extent of his power is not obvious to Di or the party
- Operates in infernal hierarchies where information and true names hold immense power

## Patron Relationships

### Sevro (Travis/Jink)
- **Contract**: Sevro sold his soul to Chopaign
- **Soul ownership**: After Mr. Hat's first 1000 years, Chopaign gets Sevro's soul for eternity
- **Visitation rights**: Bi-weekly weekend visits during Mr. Hat's 1000-year period
- **Chopaign's attitude**: Views Sevro as property, disappointed when Kagg failed to kill him

### Di (Dan)
- **False pretense**: Di is selling his cleric soul under false pretense to save Sevro
- **Criticism**: Chopaign has called Di out for "not being strong enough" after receiving power
- **Scimitar manifestation**: During Sevro's soul court, Di's scimitar became "absolutely molten" with red/black snake eye visible in jewel
- **Expectation**: Chopaign expects progress reports and results from Di

## The Casino Contract Situation

### Di's Mistake
Di made a contract with the Starved Goblin Casino owners (Velisara and Caldrien, both fiends) to provide **Chopaign's true eye color** within 2 months, or owe 100 starvens immediately.

**Critical oversight**: Di never asked who Velisara and Caldrien's boss is.

### When Di Asks About Eye Color

**Chopaign catches on immediately** to why Di is asking.

**His Response:**
1. **Scolds Di** for making deals with devils without learning who they serve
   - "You made a deal with devils and didn't learn who they serve? Foolish."
   - Makes it clear this is a basic failure in dealing with infernal powers
   
2. **Compares power levels** (subtly)
   - Mentions that the casino owners' boss's power is comparable to his own
   - Implies this is significant, but doesn't make it obvious how powerful he actually is
   - The comparison is designed to make Di realize he's dealing with major players
   
3. **Issues a counter-deal** (carrot and stick)
   - **What Chopaign wants**: Information about the infernal hierarchy
   - **Options for Di**:
     - Learn the casino owners' **boss's name**
     - OR learn the owners' **true names** (Velisara and Caldrien's real infernal names)
   - **Only then** will Chopaign provide his eye color to fulfill Di's contract
   
4. **The lesson**: Information is currency in the Nine Hells
   - True names grant power over devils
   - Understanding hierarchies is essential for survival
   - Di traded for something he can't deliver without doing more work

### Chopaign's Investigator

Chopaign may send his own investigator to learn about the casino owners and their boss. This investigator could:
- Cross paths with the party
- Be working parallel to Di's quest
- Provide complications or assistance depending on circumstances
- Serve as a reminder that Chopaign doesn't rely solely on his pawns

## Personality Traits
- **Calculating**: Thinks in centuries, not years
- **Disappointed easily**: Expects competence from those who serve him
- **Educational**: Will teach lessons through consequences
- **Strategic**: Always has multiple plans and backup plans
- **Hierarchical**: Understands and respects infernal power structures

## Motivations
- Expand his influence and power in the Nine Hells
- Collect souls and leverage them for advantage
- Maintain his position in infernal hierarchies
- Ensure his investments (like Di and Sevro) provide returns

## Known Abilities
- Patron powers granted to warlocks
- Can manifest through contracted items (Di's scimitar)
- Communication with contracted individuals
- [More to be revealed]

## Current Goals
- Monitor Di's progress and ensure he becomes stronger
- Collect Sevro's soul (eventually)
- Learn more about the casino owners' boss (potential rival or ally?)
- Maintain his standing among archdevils

## Notes for DM
- Chopaign represents consequences for short-term thinking
- His disappointment in Di is genuine—he wants competent servants
- The eye color question turns into a lesson about infernal politics
- Consider what Chopaign gains from this situation beyond just testing Di

**Unarmored Defense:** While not wearing armor, the monk's AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

### Actions

**Multiattack:** The hag spawn monk makes two unarmed strikes and can use one additional action.

**Unarmed Strike:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) lightning damage.

**Lightning Fist (Recharge 5-6):** The hag spawn channels electricity into its fists before releasing. Each creature within 15 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) lightning damage.

**Ki Abilities (Recharge 5-6):**
- **Flurry of Blows:** Immediately after taking the Attack action on its turn, the monk can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
- **Patient Defense:** The monk can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on its turn.
- **Step of the Wind:** The monk can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on its turn, and its jump distance is doubled for the turn.
- **Thunderous Reprisal:** When hit by an attack, the monk can spend 2 ki points to deal 13 (3d8) lightning damage to the attacker, as electricity surges in a burst of retaliation.

**Evasion:** When subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the monk instead takes no damage on a success, and half damage on a failure.

**Stillness of Mind:** The monk can use its action to end one effect on itself that is causing it to be charmed or frightened.

**Reactions**

**Deflect Missiles:** The monk can use its reaction to deflect or catch the missile when it is hit by a ranged weapon attack. The damage from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + 7. If the damage is reduced to 0, the monk can catch the missile if it is small enough and the monk has at least one hand free.

# Notes
- Ran from the wolves
- Bumped into a strange dude on the side of the road
    - Effortlessly made the wolves run away
    - Mentioned "The Pickled Hen" Inn and to mention he sent me
    - Mentioned his name was Roi Sunderhammer
    - He's in town for a funeral
    - He plans on speaking to the wolves
- Some drunk dude wanted to fight but I calmed him down
- Tanya Anathram introduced herself as the mayor and asked that I find her after the funeral
- The parents gave a speech, they seem to want isolation
- The husband to be, Tomlin, gave a speech
    - The ladies in the room seemed less happy than the rest that poor Maybelline has passed away
- Tanya gave her reasons for her mayorship, something about her story seemed off but I couldn't put my finger on it
- Tanya has hired me to investigate this murder. She's put me up in The Speckled Hen inn, purchasing a room and offering to pay for it as long as I am investigating the murder
    - She didn't seem to do this out of kindness or belief, but more so as a scape goat if need be
- The druid made his speech, something really didn't feel right and.. did he briefly turn into a wolf between sneezes?
- The cleric I met on the way to the inn gave a wonderful speech in stark contrast to her earlier demenor
    - Though she seems new / young, the belief in town seems rooted and old

- Went to Tomlin's house
    - As I got there he burst out the door with another woman already on his lips
    - When I quesitoned him about it he couldn't even keep his story straight
- I asked him where he was the night of the murder
    - He said out with an impromptu stag party, many witnesses
- When I asked him about any potential enemies of Maybelline he beat around a bush and didn't give me a straight answer
- Finally when I asked him about any strange events around town he mentioned two
    - The wolves around Langston have become more active
    - There have been riff-raff that have been hanging outside the city walls..
        - And that the farmers have been complaining about theft.. could these things be related?

- Tomlin thanked me and gave me a potion (Philter of Rememberance)
- Went back to the inn and up to my room
- Deep in the night I saw a strange hairy creature on the neighboring buildings roof. 
    - It pointed at me..
    - When I went down to confront it, it had vanished.
    - I climbed up the roof to where the creature was standing, strangely there were only the claw marks where he was.. not how he got there
- I went back inside and stayed up the rest of the night.

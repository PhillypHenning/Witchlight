# Notes
- Ran from the wolves
- Bumped into a strange dude on the side of the road
    - Effortlessly made the wolves run away
    - Mentioned "The Pickled Hen" Inn and to mention he sent me
    - Mentioned his name was Roi Sunderhammer
    - He's in town for a funeral
    - He plans on speaking to the wolves
- Some drunk dude wanted to fight but I calmed him down
- Tanya Anathram introduced herself as the mayor and asked that I find her after the funeral
- The parents gave a speech, they seem to want isolation
- The husband to be, Tomlin, gave a speech
    - The ladies in the room seemed less happy than the rest that poor Maybelline has passed away
- Tanya gave her reasons for her mayorship, something about her story seemed off but I couldn't put my finger on it
- Tanya has hired me to investigate this murder. She's put me up in The Speckled Hen inn, purchasing a room and offering to pay for it as long as I am investigating the murder
    - She didn't seem to do this out of kindness or belief, but more so as a scape goat if need be
- The druid made his speech, something really didn't feel right and.. did he briefly turn into a wolf between sneezes?
- The cleric I met on the way to the inn gave a wonderful speech in stark contrast to her earlier demenor
    - Though she seems new / young, the belief in town seems rooted and old
- Ended on [26]

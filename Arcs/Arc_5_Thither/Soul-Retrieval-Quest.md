# Soul Retrieval Quest - Sevro's Father

## Overview
A major side quest where Chopaign sends Di and the party to retrieve Sevro's father's soul from a rival archdevil's domain. This is all part of Chopaign's cruel plan to torment Sevro emotionally by forcing him to choose between his own suffering and his father's.

## The Setup

### Chopaign's Request to Di
**When**: After Di has proven somewhat useful, likely mid-to-late Arc 5 or later
**Where**: During one of Di's patron communications (scimitar manifestation or summoning)

**What Chopaign Says**:
- "Your service has been... adequate. Now I require something more substantial."
- Explains that Sevro's father's soul is held by a rival archdevil (name TBD)
- Claims he wants to "help" Sevro by retrieving the soul
- Doesn't reveal his true plan (to torment Sevro with an impossible choice)
- Provides each party member with a **Scroll of Return**
  - Returns user to Chopaign's sitting room (where he usually meets with Di)
  - One-time use, emergency escape
  - "Insurance for my investment"

### What Di Knows
- Chopaign wants Sevro's father's soul retrieved
- It's held by another powerful archdevil
- This is dangerous work, hence the escape scrolls
- Di believes this will somehow help Sevro
- Di doesn't know about the cruel choice Chopaign plans to present

### What Sevro Knows
- His father died when he was a teenager
- Father was a famous bard known for upbeat tunes
- Had to sell father's lute to pay father's debts
- Doesn't know his father's soul is held by an archdevil
- Won't know about this quest unless Di tells him

## The Rival Archdevil

### Identity [DM TO DETERMINE]
**Name**: [TBD - something intimidating and infernal]
**Domain**: [TBD - location in Nine Hells or a pocket dimension]
**Relationship to Chopaign**: 
- Rival, not enemy (they respect each other's power)
- Collects souls as trophies or currency
- May be willing to deal rather than fight
- Has leverage over Chopaign somehow (holding this soul)

### Why They Have the Soul
**Possible reasons:**
- Sevro's father made his own deal years ago
- The soul was traded/stolen as part of infernal politics
- Chopaign lost it in a wager and wants it back without admitting defeat
- The soul has special properties/value
- [DM Decision]

### Power Level
- Comparable to Chopaign (archdevil tier)
- Too powerful for party to fight directly (CR 15-20+)
- Requires infiltration, negotiation, or theft
- Has minions, guards, and infernal defenses

## The Quest Structure

### Phase 1: Information Gathering
**Before they go:**
- Research the rival archdevil (name, domain, weaknesses)
- Learn about infernal etiquette and contracts
- Gather resources, prepare contingencies
- Decide who goes (whole party? Just some members?)

**Sources of information:**
- Chopaign (limited, plays cards close to vest)
- Starved Goblin Casino owners (Caldrien & Velisara know infernal hierarchies)
- Libraries (Fablerise if still accessible)
- Other devils/fiends they've encountered
- Divination magic

### Phase 2: Infiltration
**Getting in:**
- Portal provided by Chopaign? Or find their own way?
- Disguises, illusions, or stealth
- Claiming to be emissaries, supplicants, or merchants
- Scrolls of Return as escape plan

**The Domain:**
- Infernal architecture: oppressive, grand, designed to intimidate
- Lesser devils and fiends as guards/servants
- Souls imprisoned or displayed as trophies
- Contracts and deals being negotiated constantly
- Everything has a price

### Phase 3: The Retrieval
**Options:**
1. **Negotiate**: Trade something for the soul
   - What do they have that an archdevil wants?
   - Information about Chopaign?
   - Future favors (dangerous)?
   - Other souls (darker option)?

2. **Steal**: Infiltrate where souls are kept
   - Security will be formidable
   - Identifying which soul is Sevro's father's
   - Magical containers, wards, traps
   - Stealth vs. action movie heist

3. **Challenge**: Formal infernal challenge/game
   - Devils love contracts and games
   - Wager something against the soul
   - Riddles, contests, trials
   - Rules must be followed precisely

4. **Third Party**: Find someone else who wants to undermine the rival
   - Other devils plotting against them
   - Imprisoned entities who want revenge
   - Create chaos, steal during confusion

### Phase 4: Escape
**Getting out:**
- Use Scrolls of Return (instant escape to Chopaign's sitting room)
- Fight their way out (if things go wrong)
- Negotiate safe passage as part of deal
- Run and hide until they can escape

**Complications:**
- The rival may send forces after them
- Chopaign may be displeased if they made unauthorized deals
- Other archdevils may take notice of the party
- Infernal politics become relevant to campaign

## The Cruel Reveal

### When They Return
Party returns to Chopaign's sitting room with Sevro's father's soul (presumably in a container/vessel).

**Chopaign's reaction:**
- Pleased they succeeded
- Dismisses everyone except Di and Sevro
- Tells Sevro what they retrieved
- Reveals his "generous offer"

### The Impossible Choice
Chopaign presents Sevro with two options:

1. **Continue his current fate**:
   - 1000 years tormented by Mr. Hat
   - Eternity after that tormented by Chopaign
   - Father's soul remains with Chopaign (fate unclear, probably bad)

2. **Replace himself with his father**:
   - Father's soul takes Sevro's place in the contracts
   - Father suffers the 1000 years + eternity
   - Sevro goes free
   - Sevro must live knowing he damned his father

**Either way, Chopaign wins:**
- Sevro suffers emotionally regardless of choice
- If Sevro chooses to suffer himself: prolonged anguish
- If Sevro damns his father: guilt and grief forever
- The strife and torment are what Chopaign truly wanted
- This is pure cruelty disguised as mercy

### Di's Realization
Di realizes he was used to orchestrate his friend's torture:
- He thought he was helping Sevro
- He retrieved the soul that enabled this cruel choice
- Chopaign manipulated him perfectly
- His patron is far more evil than he understood

## Consequences & Aftermath

### If Sevro Chooses to Suffer
- Father's soul: What does Chopaign do with it? Keep as trophy? Release?
- Sevro: Continues knowing his fate, but father is safe(?)
- Di: Guilt for failing to save his friend
- Chopaign: Satisfied with Sevro's nobility and ongoing torment

### If Sevro Sacrifices His Father
- Father: Takes Sevro's place in the contracts (horrible)
- Sevro: Free but wracked with guilt and grief
- Di: Horror at what he helped accomplish
- Chopaign: Delighted by Sevro's selfishness and resulting anguish

### Third Option?
Could there be a way out?
- Break the contracts (nearly impossible with archdevils)
- Find another soul to trade (who? at what cost?)
- Outsmart Chopaign somehow (he's extremely intelligent)
- Convince Mr. Hat to release his claim (unlikely)
- Appeal to higher power (Baba Yaga? Zalbina? Gods?)

## Integration with Main Campaign

### Timing
- Place this quest when ready for major side adventure
- Probably not during critical main plot moments
- Could be Arc 5 late, Arc 6, or even Arc 7
- Needs session(s) of pure focus

### Party Investment
**Why others would help:**
- **Yanaba**: Friendship, understanding soul-related pain (parents imprisoned)
- **Karag**: Paladin oath to fight evil, protect friends
- **Seren**: [Her motivations TBD, but likely compassionate]
- **Others**: Loyalty, adventure, infernal loot?

### Rewards (Besides Emotional Trauma)
- Scrolls of Return (used up in escape)
- Infernal treasures/artifacts from the domain
- Knowledge about archdevil hierarchies
- Potential allies/enemies among devils
- Experience with Nine Hells (useful later?)

## DM Preparation Needed

### Decisions to Make
1. **Rival Archdevil**: Name, personality, domain appearance, motivations
2. **Why they have the soul**: History between them and Chopaign
3. **Domain details**: Layout, defenders, atmosphere, hazards
4. **Retrieval method**: Which approach seems most interesting?
5. **Father's soul appearance**: How is it contained/identified?
6. **Potential deals**: What might the rival want in trade?
7. **Escape complications**: What goes wrong on the way out?
8. **Third option**: Is there a way out of Chopaign's trap?

### Tone & Themes
- **Infernal politics**: Devils are lawful, bureaucratic, cruel
- **Everything has a price**: No free lunch in the Hells
- **Contracts are binding**: Exact wording matters
- **Cruelty disguised as civility**: Devils are polite while being evil
- **Impossible choices**: No good options, only lesser evils
- **Manipulation**: Chopaign uses Di's love for his friend against both of them

### Session Planning
This could take 1-3 sessions depending on:
- How much preparation/investigation the party does
- Which approach they choose
- How much you expand the rival's domain
- Combat vs. social encounter ratio
- Whether they try to find a third option

## Notes & Reminders

### For Di/Dan
- Di thinks he's helping Sevro
- The betrayal/manipulation will hit hard
- This tests his relationship with Chopaign
- Does he remain a warlock after this?

### For Sevro/Travis
- Ultimate test of character: self vs. father
- No right answer, only what Sevro can live with
- Player choice matters deeply here
- Travis should not feel railroaded into either option

### For the Table
- This is heavy, emotional content
- Check in with players about comfort level
- The "impossible choice" trope can be powerful but draining
- Make sure it feels earned, not gratuitous

### Chopaign's Character
- This reveals how truly evil he is
- Not just collecting souls - enjoying suffering
- Lawful evil at its most cruel
- But still respects contracts and rules (can't lie, can manipulate)

## Future Hooks

### Revenge on Chopaign?
- Can they break free of him eventually?
- Will they seek revenge for this manipulation?
- Could become end-of-campaign goal

### Infernal Enemies
- The rival archdevil may remember them
- Other devils may take interest
- Nine Hells connection established

### Di's Patron Crisis
- Does he keep serving Chopaign after this?
- Can he break the warlock contract?
- What would that cost?

### Sevro's Development
- Whichever choice he makes defines his character
- Guilt, grief, determination, or acceptance
- Long-term roleplay opportunities

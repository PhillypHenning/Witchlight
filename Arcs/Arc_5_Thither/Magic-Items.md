# Magic Items Collection (Arc 4 & 5)

## Mundane Magical Items
1. **Whispering Fern**: A small potted fern that quietly repeats any conversation held nearby within the last hour. Ideal for eavesdropping or remembering forgotten details.

2. **Glimmer Pebble**: A small stone that emits a soft, ambient glow in darkness but does not provide enough light to illuminate anything beyond a few inches. Adds eerie ambiance rather than practical utility.

3. **Echoing Shell**: A seashell that, when held to the ear, plays the sounds of a distant battlefield—clanging swords, war cries, and orders shouted over the din.

4. **Chill Cloth**: A handkerchief that feels perpetually cold to the touch. Useful for cooling overheated tempers or offering solace in stress.

5. **Mimic Mirror Shard**: A shard of mirror that perfectly reflects everything except the observer, always showing them as their younger self when viewed.

## Low Tier Magical Items
1. **Amulet of Healthful Sleep**: This amulet ensures that while worn, the user cannot be affected by nonmagical fatigue and gains the benefits of a long rest with only 4 hours of sleep.

2. **Breezewhisper Cloak**: Grants the wearer advantage on checks made to hide or move silently. The cloak itself appears to ripple gently, as if caught in a breeze.

3. **Graveyard Twig Wand**: Allows the user to cast *Chill Touch* once per day. The wand looks like a twisted twig from an ancient tree, dark and dry.

4. **Ring of the Drifting Leaf**: Allows the wearer to cast *Feather Fall* once per long rest. The ring is delicate and made of interwoven leaves petrified into jade.

5. **Brooch of Misting**: Once per day, the user can shroud themselves in a 10-foot cube of mist for 1 minute, granting light obscurity. It resembles a clouded teardrop when unattuned.

6. **Vow Keeper Ring**: This gold ring is engraved with symbols representing trust and fidelity. With their partner's consent, the wearer can cast *Sanctuary* on them once per day. Additionally, if one partner falls unconscious, the ring will emit a gentle, glowing light and a soft chime to alert the other partner.

## Spell Scrolls
1. **Scroll of Faerie Fire**: A scroll that casts *Faerie Fire*, illuminating adversaries with a glinting glow and outlining invisible objects for identification.

2. **Scroll of Detect Magic**: Enables the user to see magical auras and faint glows around enchanted objects for 10 minutes.

3. **Scroll of Entangle**: Causes vines to spring from the ground within a 20-foot square, immobilizing creatures caught within.

4. **Scroll of Shield**: Instantly conjures a magical shield to add temporary protection from a single attack.

5. **Scroll of Cure Wounds**: Restores a small amount of health to a wounded ally upon touch, channeling basic healing energies.

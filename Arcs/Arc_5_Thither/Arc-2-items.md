### 5 Mundane Magical Items
1. [Karag] **Whispering Fern**: A small potted fern that quietly repeats any conversation held nearby within the last hour. Ideal for eavesdropping or remembering forgotten details.

2. **Glimmer Pebble**: A small stone that emits a soft, ambient glow in darkness but does not provide enough light to illuminate anything beyond a few inches. Adds eerie ambiance rather than practical utility.

2. **Scroll of Detect Magic**: Enables the user to see magical auras and faint glows around enchanted objects for 10 minutes.

3. **Scroll of Entangle**: Causes vines to spring from the ground within a 20-foot square, immobilizing creatures caught within.

# Never Leave Spa - The False Hydra

## The False Hydra

**What It Is:**
A False Hydra is a horrific aberration that grows multiple heads and produces a hypnotic song that makes people forget it exists—and forget anyone it has eaten. In this encounter, the False Hydra has taken over a spa, using the relaxing atmosphere and massage services as cover for its feeding.

**Appearance:**
- **True Form**: Three serpentine necks emerging from a bloated, pale body hidden in the spa's basement
- **Each Head**: Blind, eyeless, with massive jaws full of needle teeth
- **Size**: Each neck is 20+ feet long, body is size of a carriage
- **Song**: Constant, barely audible humming that sounds like relaxing spa music

**How The Song Works:**
- **Effect**: Anyone who hears it forgets the False Hydra exists
- **Range**: 300 feet (covers entire spa complex)
- **Mechanics**: Wis save DC 15 each hour, failure means you forget:
  - Seeing the creature
  - People it has eaten
  - Injuries it caused (they "happened some other way")
  - Warnings others gave you
- **Breaking Free**: Taking damage, *Lesser Restoration*, ally reminding you (DC 15 Wisdom check)

## The Never Leave Spa Complex

**Exterior:**
A beautiful structure built around natural hot springs, with steam rising from multiple pools. Bamboo fencing, paper lanterns, flower gardens. Sign: "Never Leave Spa - Relaxation Guaranteed."

**Front Desk:**
Staffed by three "attendants" who are actually thralls—people who've been partially eaten but kept alive to lure others. They smile too wide, move stiffly, and have gaps in their memories.

**Massage Rooms:**
Individual treatment rooms where the False Hydra's heads emerge from ceiling/floor vents. Guests are lured here, relaxed with song, then consumed. The room is "cleaned" and ready for the next victim.

**Hot Springs:**
Multiple pools of various temperatures. Some are genuine (fed by natural springs), others lead to the creature's lair. Guests who soak too long fall unconscious and are dragged below.

**Steam Room:**
Thick steam obscures vision. The False Hydra uses this to move heads without being seen. Blood and gore are blamed on "slipping on wet tiles."

**VIP Suite:**
Where high-value victims are taken. Promises of premium treatments. Actually the most direct access to the creature's main body.

**Basement Lair:**
Where the False Hydra's body rests. Piles of belongings from victims, bones, and thralls kept in cages. The song is loudest here (disadvantage on saves).

## The False Hydra's Tactics

1. **Lure**: Attendants offer free treatments, special deals, "you look so tense!"
2. **Separate**: Break up groups—"we only have individual rooms available"
3. **Relax**: Soothing music, hot water, massage—lower defenses
4. **Feed**: One head attacks while song prevents screaming/memory
5. **Clean**: Thralls remove evidence, reset room
6. **Expand**: Use victim's belongings to lure friends/family

**In Combat:**
- Uses song to make allies forget it's there
- Attacks from unexpected angles (ceiling, floor, walls)
- Focuses on isolated targets
- Retreats to lair if seriously injured
- Thralls fight to defend it (but reluctantly)

## Victims & Thralls

**Types of Thralls:**
1. **Fresh** (1-3 days): Still mostly themselves, confused, "did I fall?"
2. **Partial** (1 week): Major chunks missing, personality gaps, obedient
3. **Hollow** (2+ weeks): Barely human, follow commands mindlessly

**Notable Victims:**
- **Caldwen Brightbrook** - Human scholar researching Feywild, came here 2 weeks ago, now hollow thrall
- **Mira and Tonn** - Halfling couple celebrating anniversary, Mira eaten completely, Tonn partial thrall who doesn't remember her
- **Lord Vex** - Tiefling noble, fresh victim, badly injured, can be saved if found quickly

## Clues Something Is Wrong

Before entering fully:
- Reviews mention people who "left early" but no one saw them go
- Steam always smells faintly of copper (blood)
- Too many "accidents" - slips, falls, injuries
- Staff smiles are uncomfortable, forced
- Same soothing music plays constantly
- Nobody remembers when spa opened or who owns it

Inside:
- Belongings left behind (wallets, shoes, weapons)
- Blood stains that "were always there"
- Attendants can't remember their own names
- Rooms have lockable doors (locks on outside)
- Vents and openings are too large for normal plumbing
- Charts show guests who never checked out

**Stage 4 - Revelation:**

**Stage 5 - Resolution:**

## Roleplaying the Thralls

**Fresh Thralls**:
- "I... I think I fell? My arm hurts but I can't remember..."
- "Have you seen my friend? We came together... I think?"
- "The music is so nice here. Don't you think? So... nice..."

**Partial Thralls**:
- "Welcome to Never Leave. Treatment? Yes. Follow."
- Mechanical smiles, dead eyes
- Repeat phrases: "Relaxation guaranteed" "You'll love it here" "Nobody ever wants to leave"

**Hollow Thralls**:
- Don't speak unless commanded
- Follow simple orders only
- Vacant stares, shambling movement
- Will fight to defend the False Hydra (reluctantly)

## Aftermath

**If Defeated:**
- Thralls slowly recover (fresh ones fully, partial ones partially, hollow ones lost)
- Victims' families might seek party out to thank them
- Belongings include some valuable items (random treasure)
- Other establishments in Thither are relieved/suspicious
- Skabatha might be annoyed (it was keeping people away from other areas)

**If Escaped:**
- False Hydra continues feeding
- Party might forget they were ever there
- Can return later to try again
- Other adventurers/victims accumulate

**Connection to Casino:**
Velisara and Caldrien HATE the spa because it competes for customers. If party destroys it, the casino owners are grateful and might offer rewards/information.

## DM Notes

**Balancing Difficulty:**
- Song save DC can be adjusted (lower for easier, higher for brutal)
- Number of heads can change (1 head = CR 4, 2 = CR 6, 3 = CR 8, 4 = CR 10)
- Thralls can help or hinder party
- Environmental hazards (hot water, steam, slippery floors) add challenge

**Pacing:**
- Don't rush the horror build-up
- Let players forget things, then realize they forgot
- Use thralls to unsettle before revealing monster
- The "oh no" moment should come when they realize they've been here before but don't remember

**Player Agency:**
- Don't take away too much control with the song
- Allow clever solutions (plugging ears, *Silence* spell, etc.)
- Reward investigation and caution
- Let them choose to flee if outmatched

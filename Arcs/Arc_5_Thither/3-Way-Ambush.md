# 3-Way Ambush

## Overview
A coordinated ambush where three members of the party are simultaneously attacked by different enemies, each with their own agenda. This encounter is the **Session 4 cliffhanger** — the party wakes at camp surrounded. Three factions close in at once, splitting the party's attention and advancing multiple plot threads.

## Timing
- **Triggered**: Session 4 cliffhanger — factions spotted approaching camp
- Party is at camp, just waking — not fully rested, caught off-guard

## The Three Simultaneous Attacks

### 1. Sevro's Attack — The Downfall Challengers

**Attackers**: A Knight and Squire from Downfall

**Approaching**: Four figures from the south

**Background**:
- Sevro inadvertently became King of Downfall by killing the previous king
- In Downfall, collective frog-people belief shapes reality — they now believe him a malevolent god who disrupted their "harmony" (of killing each other for titles)
- That belief made it real: Sevro is now a minor god and cursed King
- **The godhood marked Sevro with terrible luck** — everything that can go wrong will
- These two have come to claim his crown and end his "mad tyranny"
- **Bavlorna is NOT aware of Sevro's godhood status**

**Motivation**:
- Kill Sevro, claim the title of King of Downfall
- Revenge for Kagg (previous frog knight Sevro killed)
- Glory and the power that comes with the crown

**Setup**:
- The Knight steps forward with a formal declaration
- *"I claim your crown, false king! Face me, mad tyrant!"*
- The Squire flanks to cut off Sevro's escape
- Knight wants single combat; Squire interferes if Sevro is winning

**Tactics**:
- Knight engages Sevro in melee, Squire uses ranged harass or flanks
- If the Knight falls, the Squire retreats to report back
- Will not attack other party members unless they directly intervene

**Stats**:
- **Knight**: [TBD — use Knight stat block MM p. 347, or reskinned similar to Kagg]
- **Squire**: [TBD — CR 1-2, use Scout or Thug stat block]

**Conclusion**:
- Dead knight = another mark against party with Downfall (not Bavlorna)
- Captured knight can confirm: more will come — the crown must change hands
- Retreat means reinforcements next time
- Sevro's terrible luck continues — of course someone came for his accidental crown

### 2. Yanaba's Attack — The Kidnappers

**Attackers**: 2 Kidnappers serving Skabatha Nightshade

**Approaching**: Two pairs of yellow eyes from the east

**Background — Cinder Hold Prison (Sindrhald)**:
- When Prismeer fractured, **Yggmir the Ancient** (the world tree treant) was split in two
- The Thither half was set ablaze with witchfire by Skabatha, boarded up, filled with iron
- Now called **Cinder Hold** (*Sindrhald*) — a living prison that serves as its own security, crushing escapees
- All free Harengon are to be captured and brought to Cinder Hold by Skabatha's order
- Yanaba's birth parents are already imprisoned there
- The kidnappers have spotted a free Harengon — Yanaba — and intend to take her

**Motivation**:
- All free Harengon belong in Cinder Hold by Skabatha's standing order
- Yanaba's parents are already there — she's the missing piece
- Capture, not kill

**Setup**:
- Emerge from shadows with nets, grapples, and restraints
- Move with practiced silence — this is their job
- Focus entirely on Yanaba; ignore others unless interfered with
- Non-lethal tactics only for Yanaba; lethal force authorized for anyone who interferes

**Tactics**:
- Swarm Yanaba; attempt grapple + restrain
- Use nets to reduce her speed
- Drag her away from camp toward containment
- If captured: *"The Night Shade wants the rabbit-child. The family will be reunited in Sindrhald."*

**Stats**:
- **2 Kidnappers**: [TBD — use Bandit Captain or Thug stat blocks; add Net as bonus action]

**Conclusion**:
- **If successful**: Yanaba captured; party must raid Cinder Hold Prison to rescue her and her parents
- **If repelled**: Kidnappers retreat; party now knows Skabatha is actively hunting Yanaba
- Captured kidnapper reveals Cinder Hold's existence and Yanaba's parents' location

### 3. Karag's Attack — The Twilight Spirits

**Attackers**: 4 Twilight Spirits (CR 1/2 each — see stat block below)

**Approaching**: Four ethereal black-cloaked figures from the west

**Background**:
- Remnants of the Twilight Court, drawn by the latent magic in Karag's curse tattoo
- Karag's **Heir of Twilight** status is bloodline/prophecy — separate from the curse
- The curse tattoo acts as a tracking beacon; the spirits sensed it and followed
- As they approach, the curse causes Karag intense pain (not bleeding)
- These are fragments of what once was — corrupted, desperate, reaching out to their lost heir

**Motivation**:
- Drawn instinctively to the heir via the curse's latent magic
- Testing? Claiming? Unclear even to them — driven by remnant instinct
- Speak in fragmented whispers: *"The blood of your ancestors beckons..."* *"Heir..."* *"What remains..."* *"Remember us..."*

**Setup**:
- Shadows coalesce around Karag
- Curse tattoo burns with intense pain as the beacon pulses
- Tattered remnants of courtly garb visible in their ethereal forms
- Attack with desperate, clawing strikes — compelled rather than tactical

**Seren's Compulsion**:
- Seren feels an overwhelming need to protect Karag
- Wisdom save DC 13 to resist throwing herself between Karag and the spirits
- No clear reason — purely instinctual
- Could be divine calling, past-life connection, or something about the heir's true nature

**Tactics**:
- Surround Karag, fixated on the curse mark
- Attempt to separate him from the party
- Strike with desperate, clawing fury (see stat block)
- May pause if Karag speaks words of recognition or acknowledgment
- Cease attacking if the curse is dispelled or Karag names them

**Conclusion**:
- Spirits dissipate with final words: *"The blood remembers..."* *"Not yet ready..."* *"Heir... of ash and twilight..."*
- Curse tattoo stops hurting but remains
- Karag's Twilight Court connection deepens — clearly dangerous
- Seren's compulsion revealed — why does she feel this?
- **Removing the curse won't remove his Heir status**, but may make him harder to track

TRAITS

Incorporeal Movement. The spirit can move through creatures and objects as
if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends
its turn inside an object.

Heir's Beacon. While within 1 mile of Karag's curse tattoo, the spirit
automatically knows his exact location. The spirit has advantage on attack
rolls against Karag.

Twilight Aura. Nonmagical light within 10 feet of the spirit is reduced to
dim light.
────────────────────────────────────────

Spectral Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) necrotic damage.

Whisper of Ruin (1/Day). One creature the spirit can see within 30 feet
must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the
spirit until the end of its next turn. On a failed save, the creature
hears fragmented whispers: "Remember us..." "What remains..."
────────────────────────────────────────
DM OPTIONS
- Vulnerability to radiant damage (gives Karag's paladin kit a meaningful
  role in fighting his own ancestral ghosts)
- If Karag speaks words of recognition ("I am the Heir"), spirits pause
  one round — DM discretion
- Spirits dissipate rather than die; may leave a Twilight Shard (flavor
  item — dim glowing essence, use TBD)
```

## Running the Encounter

### Initiative & Positioning
- All three attacks begin simultaneously — coordinated by circumstance, not alliance
- Roll separate initiatives for each group:
  - Knight & Squire
  - Kidnappers
  - Twilight Spirits
- Party is at camp — potentially mid-sleep, not yet in combat positions

### Split Attention
- Party can realistically handle 2 of 3 attacks effectively
- They must choose who to help and who to leave exposed
- Each PC decides: handle their own threat or cross to help another
- Healing resources spread thin; AOE may hit allies
- Designed to be overwhelming and force difficult choices

### Victory Conditions

**For the Party**:
- Survive all three attacks
- Prevent Yanaba from being captured (primary stakes)
- Defeat or drive off all groups
- Learn information from attackers

**For the Attackers**:
- **Downfall**: Kill Sevro, claim the crown
- **Kidnappers**: Capture Yanaba alive
- **Spirits**: Reach/claim/test Karag

### Post-Battle
- Multiple plot threads advanced at once
- Urgency increased — Skabatha is actively hunting Yanaba
- Downfall's reach extends into Thither — Sevro can't outrun his crown
- Karag's mystery deepens — the Court's remnants are aware of him
- Seren's compulsion is now visible to the party

---

## Loot & Rewards
- **Knight**: [TBD — sealed letter from Downfall, Kagg's ring or token, written commission]
- **Kidnappers**: [TBD — map fragment toward Cinder Hold, Skabatha's written orders]
- **Spirits**: No physical loot; may leave a **Twilight Shard** (dim glowing fragment — DM to define use)

## Follow-Up Hooks
- **Sevro**: More challengers will come. The crown follows him wherever he goes.
- **Yanaba**: Parents are imprisoned at Cinder Hold (Sindrhald). Skabatha knows about her.
- **Karag**: The Twilight Court is calling. What does it want from its Heir?
- **Seren**: Why did she feel compelled to protect Karag? Does she know?

## DM Notes
- This encounter is cinematic — overwhelming but survivable
- Don't kill PCs; make them feel the danger and the cost
- Each attack ties directly to a major arc plot thread
- Success should feel earned but costly
- If Yanaba is captured, Cinder Hold becomes an immediate destination
- Adjust difficulty based on party resources post-casino

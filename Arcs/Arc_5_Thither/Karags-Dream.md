# Karag's Dream - Three Paths

## When This Occurs
- During a long rest after significant events
- When Karag's identity and purpose are being questioned
- Before or after major choice points in his character arc
- Possibly before the 4-Way Ambush (foreshadowing the spirits)

## The Dream Sequence

### The Chamber
Karag stands in a vast circular chamber of dark stone. Three paths stretch before him, each emanating a different energy. The air is thick with significance—this is a choice that matters, though he doesn't yet understand why.

Above, the ceiling is lost in shadow. Below, the floor is polished obsidian that reflects not his current self, but three different versions of him.

### Path One: Fury (The Curse)

**Visual**:
- Path glows with sickly green-yellow light
- Swamp gas and decay smell fills the air
- Bavlorna's curse manifests visibly
- The path writhes like a living thing

**Karag's Reflection**:
- Eyes filled with rage
- Body twisted by curse
- Powerful but uncontrolled
- Feral, barely recognizable

**Voice of Fury**:
"Embrace what she made you. Use the rage. Let it consume them before it consumes you."

**Symbolism**:
- The curse as a source of power
- Giving in to corruption
- Strength through suffering
- Becoming the monster others fear

---

### Path Two: Stillness (Grumbar/Paladin Oaths)

**Visual**:
- Path is solid stone, unmoving
- Earth element surrounds it
- Holy symbols of Grumbar carved into floor
- Absolute stability and order

**Karag's Reflection**:
- Resolute, unmoving
- Paladin armor gleaming
- Hand on holy symbol
- Expression of calm determination

**Voice of Stillness**:
"Stand firm. Be the mountain. Your oaths are your foundation. Let nothing move you from righteousness."

**Symbolism**:
- Oath of Landwalking
- Sardonyx Knight of Grumbar
- Lawful good alignment
- Duty and honor above all
- The weight of expectations

---

### Path Three: The Throne (Fighter/New Way)

**Visual**:
- Path leads to a throne carved from twilight itself
- Neither dark nor light, but the space between
- Crown of shadows and starlight floats above it
- The path shifts and changes as he watches

**Karag's Reflection**:
- Regal, powerful
- No holy symbols or curse marks
- Wearing armor of his own making
- Expression of authority and choice

**Voice of the Throne**:
"Heir of Twilight. These are not your only choices. You can forge your own path. Take what is yours."

**Symbolism**:
- Fighter multiclass option
- Reclaiming Twilight Court heritage
- Making his own destiny
- Leadership and sovereignty
- Breaking from both curse and oath

---

## The Philosophical Voice

### The Questions
As Karag stands between the three paths, a fourth voice emerges. It comes from everywhere and nowhere, neither male nor female, neither kind nor cruel. Simply... present.

**The Voice asks**:

1. "Why are these your choices?"
   - Who decided fury, stillness, and ambition were your only options?
   - Are these truly paths, or cages with open doors?

2. "Why must you follow these?"
   - What happens if you walk between the paths?
   - What if you carve a fourth way?

3. "Who decides what you become?"
   - The hag who cursed you?
   - The god who called you?
   - The court that claims you?
   - Or you?

4. "What do you want, Karag?"
   - Not what duty demands
   - Not what the curse drives you toward
   - Not what your heritage expects
   - What do *you* want?

5. "Are you the paladin? The cursed? The heir?"
   - Or are these masks you wear?
   - Can you be all three?
   - Can you be none?

### The Voice's Nature
- Not an entity, but Karag's own deep consciousness
- Possibly influenced by his connection to the Twilight Court
- Could be the dream itself questioning its own structure
- Represents the player's agency vs. narrative/mechanical constraints

## The Dream's Interruption

### Before Karag Can Choose
The dream shifts. The chamber cracks. The three paths begin to splinter.

**Shadows emerge** (foreshadowing the spirits in 4-Way Ambush):
- Three shadowy figures materialize
- They reach for Karag
- Whisper: "Heir..." "Return..." "Not yet..."
- The dream ends abruptly

### Karag Wakes
- No clear answer
- The philosophical questions linger
- Memory of the three paths remains vivid
- Sense that this choice is coming, whether he's ready or not
- If before the ambush: Déjà vu when the spirits appear

---

## Mechanical Implications

### This Dream Is About:
1. **Multiclass choice**: Fighter multiclass option presented narratively
2. **Character identity**: Who is Karag beyond his class labels?
3. **Player agency**: Questioning the "rails" of destiny/prophecy
4. **Future direction**: Opening possibilities beyond binary choices

### DM Guidance:
- **Don't force a choice**: This is exploration, not decision time
- **Honor player's interpretation**: Cas's take on the dream matters most
- **Use for foreshadowing**: The spirits in the dream appear in 4-Way Ambush
- **Revisit later**: This dream can recur with new details
- **No wrong answer**: Fury, stillness, throne, or fourth way—all valid

### If Cas Engages with the Questions:
- Reward philosophical thinking with inspiration
- Allow the dream to influence future choices
- Consider mechanical benefits for embracing uncertainty
- Let Karag's path emerge from play, not predestination

## Symbolism Key

| Path | Class | Temptation | Cost |
|------|-------|-----------|------|
| Fury | Barbarian? | Power through rage | Loss of control |
| Stillness | Paladin | Righteousness | Rigidity |
| Throne | Fighter | Sovereignty | Unknown burden |
| Question | None | Freedom | Uncertainty |

## Follow-Up Scenes

### After the Dream:
- Karag can discuss with party members
- Seren might have religious insight
- Di might relate to patron/external control issues
- Yanaba might understand identity questions (swapped at birth)
- Sevro might joke but understand choosing your own path

### During the Ambush:
- When spirits attack, Karag recognizes them from the dream
- "You were in my dream..."
- Spirits respond: "And you were in ours, heir."

### Long-term:
- The three paths remain as options throughout campaign
- The philosophical voice returns at key moments
- Eventually, Karag may need to actually choose
- Or find the fourth way that wasn't offered

## DM Notes
- This dream is Cas's spotlight moment
- Don't rush through it
- Let silence be powerful
- The questions matter more than answers
- Use this to deepen Karag's arc
- Connect to "Heir of Twilight" mystery
- Foreshadow the ambush
- Respect player choice—these are options, not mandates
- The philosophical voice challenges destiny tropes
- Consider: Is the voice helping or tempting?

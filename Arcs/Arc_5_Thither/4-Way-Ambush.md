# 3

## Overview
A coordinated ambush where three members of the party are simultaneously attacked by different enemies, each with their own agenda. This encounter is designed to split the party's attention and resources while advancing multiple plot threads.

## Timing
Major encounter (every 6 overland actions). Place this when:
- Party has left the casino and is traveling through Thither
- Preferably when party is somewhat spread out or distracted
- After at least one rest since casino (to ensure they're not completely drained)

## The Three Simultaneous Attacks

### 1. Sevro's Attack - The Frog Knight Returns

**Attacker**: Frog knight from Downfall + 3 frog archers

**Background**: 
- Sevro inadvertently became a minor god and King of Downfall after killing the previous king
- In Downfall, the frog people's collective belief shapes reality
- After Sevro left, the frogs came to believe he was a malevolent god who disrupted their "harmony" (of killing each other for titles)
- This belief made it reality, granting Sevro godhood
- **The godhood itself has marked Sevro with terrible luck** - everything that can go wrong does
- The rot worm pit incident (where his friends left him) was traumatic but the unluck comes from being a god
- **Important**: Bavlorna is NOT aware of Sevro's godhood status

**Motivation**: 
- Kill Sevro to claim the title of King of Downfall
- Put down the "mad tyrant" who abandoned them
- Personal glory and the power that comes with the crown
- Revenge for previous frog knight (Kagg) who died attacking Sevro

**Setup**:
- Frog knight challenges Sevro directly with formal declaration
- "I claim your crown, false king! Face me, mad tyrant!"
- 3 archers spread out, providing covering fire and preventing escape
- Knight wants single combat but archers will interfere if Sevro's winning

**Tactics**:
- Knight engages Sevro in melee
- Archers focus fire on anyone trying to help Sevro
- If knight falls quickly, archers retreat
- If fight drags on, archers close in

**Stats**: 
- Frog Knight: [TBD - similar to Kagg]
- Frog Archers: [TBD - CR 1-2 each]

**Conclusion**:
- Dead knight becomes another mark against party with Bavlorna (though she doesn't know about Sevro's godhood)
- Captured knight could provide information about Downfall's current state
- Retreat means they'll be back with reinforcements
- Sevro's terrible luck continues—of course someone came to claim his accidental crown
- **Hidden plot**: Chopaign plans to have Di fetch Sevro's soul to return it to Sevro in exchange for his father's soul (Di and Sevro are unaware)

### 2. Yanaba's Attack - The Kidnappers

**Attackers**: Skabatha's creatures (dolgaunts or similar aberrations)

**Background - Cinder Hold Prison**:
- When Endelyn took over Thither, she corrupted Prismeer's world tree: **Yggmir the Ancient** (massive treant)
- When Prismeer fractured, Yggmir was split in two—the other half lies dead in Hither
- Skabatha set the Thither half ablaze with witchfire, boarded all windows, and filled it with iron
- The corrupted treant is now **Cinder Hold** (Old Norse: *Sindrhald*)
- The world tree was once home to all the Harengon living together
- When split, they became Cinder Hold's first prisoners (along with those in Hither)
- More prisoners have been added for various reasons since
- The Harengon are forced to breed constantly; if unwilling, Caldrien and Velisara "visit"
- The treant acts as its own security, freely moving through the prison and crushing escapees

**Motivation**:
- Skabatha Nightshade wants Yanaba for Cinder Hold's breeding program
- Harengon are particularly valuable—reuniting the family serves her purposes
- Yanaba's parents are already imprisoned—she's the missing piece

**Setup**:
- Creatures emerge from shadows/burrows
- Move with eerie silence and purpose
- Focus entirely on capturing Yanaba alive
- Use nets, grapples, and restraints
- Ignore other party members unless they interfere

**Tactics**:
- Swarm Yanaba specifically
- Attempt to grapple and drag her away
- Non-lethal tactics only for Yanaba
- Lethal force authorized for anyone else who interferes
- Goal: Take her to Cinder Hold Prison where her parents are held

**Stats**:
- [TBD - Dolgaunts CR 3, or custom creatures]
- 2-4 kidnappers depending on party level

**Conclusion**:
- If successful: Yanaba captured and taken to Cinder Hold (Sindrhald)—the corrupted, burning world tree prison
- Party must rescue her from a treant that serves as its own security, filled with iron and witchfire
- Her parents await her there, forced into Skabatha's breeding program
- If failed: Creatures retreat, but now party knows Skabatha is targeting Yanaba specifically
- Captured creature reveals: "The Night Shade wants the rabbit-child. The family will be reunited in Sindrhald."

### 3. Karag's Attack - The Twilight Spirits

**Attackers**: Three twilight spirits (use **Thug stat block**)

**Background**:
- Remnants of the Twilight Court, drawn to Karag by detecting latent magic in his curse tattoo
- **Important**: Karag's Heir of Twilight status is separate from Bavlorna's curse
  - His Heir status is likely bloodline, prophecy, or magical selection
  - The curse tattoo contains latent magic that acts as a tracking beacon
  - The curse didn't make him heir, but it helps spirits find him
- As they approach, the curse tattoo causes Karag intense pain (not bleeding)
- The spirits are fragments of what once was—corrupted, desperate, seeking their lost heir

**Motivation**:
- Drawn by the latent magic in the curse to find their heir
- Testing his worthiness? Claiming him? Destroying the curse?
- Unclear whether hostile or protective gone wrong

**Setup**:
- Shadows coalesce from darkness around Karag
- Karag's curse tattoo burns and causes intense pain, acting as a beacon
- Move with unnatural fluidity, tattered remnants of courtly garb visible
- Speak in fragmented whispers: "The blood of your ancestors beckons..." "Heir..." "What remains..." "Remember us..."
- Attack with desperate, clawing strikes

**Seren's Compulsion** (potential):
- Seren feels an overwhelming need to protect Karag
- Wisdom save to resist throwing herself between Karag and spirits
- No clear reason why—just instinctual
- Could be divine calling, or something about Karag's true nature

**Tactics**:
- Surround Karag, fixated on the painful curse mark emitting latent magic
- Attempt to separate him from the party
- Strike with desperate fury (Thug stat block melee attacks)
- May cease attack if the curse pain stops or Karag speaks certain words
- Seem compelled rather than strategic—driven by remnant instinct to find their heir
- Recognize him as heir by ancestral memory, but found him via the curse's magic

**Stats**:
- **Thug stat block** (MM p. 350)
- Three spirits, each using standard Thug stats
- Consider adding: Resistance to non-magical weapons, vulnerability to radiant damage

**Conclusion**:
- Spirits dissipate into shadow with final words: "The blood remembers..." "Not yet ready..." "Heir... of ash and twilight..."
- Karag's curse tattoo stops hurting but remains present
- Karag's connection to Twilight Court deepened—and clearly dangerous
- More questions about what "Heir of Twilight" means
- Why did Seren feel compelled to protect him?
- The Twilight Court's remnants are aware of him
- **Removing the curse won't remove his Heir status**, but may make him harder to track

## Running the Encounter

### Initiative & Positioning
- All three attacks begin on the same turn (coordinated but not allied)
- Roll separate initiatives for each group:
  - Frog Knight & Archers
  - Kidnappers
  - Shadowy Spirits
- Party members are likely spread out or caught off-guard

### Split Attention
- **Critical**: The party can realistically only handle 2 of the 3 attacks effectively
- They MUST choose who to help and who to leave vulnerable
- Each party member must decide: help themselves or help others
- Resource management becomes critical
- AOE effects might hit allies
- Communication is difficult across battlefield
- This encounter is designed to be overwhelming and force difficult choices

### Victory Conditions

**For the Party**:
- Survive without Yanaba being captured
- Defeat or drive off all three groups
- Learn information from attackers
- Protect each other despite split focus

**For the Attackers**:
- **Frog Knight**: Kill or seriously wound Sevro
- **Kidnappers**: Capture Yanaba alive
- **Spirits**: Test/claim/drain Karag

### Complications
- Other party members (Di, Seren if not with Karag) must choose who to help
- Healing resources spread thin
- Each group has different weaknesses and tactics
- Retreat may be wise but difficult

### Post-Battle
- Multiple plot threads advanced
- Information revealed about enemy factions
- Urgency increased (Skabatha actively hunting Yanaba)
- Karag's mystery deepens
- Party realizes they're being watched by multiple factions

## Loot & Rewards
- Frog Knight: [TBD - possible magic item, letter from Bavlorna]
- Kidnappers: [TBD - Map to Cinder Hold Prison, Skabatha's orders]
- Spirits: [TBD - Fragment of twilight essence, cryptic token]

## Follow-Up Hooks
- **Sevro**: More frog knights will come. Bavlorna wants him dead.
- **Yanaba**: Parents are at Cinder Hold Prison. Skabatha knows about her.
- **Karag**: The Twilight Court is calling. What does it want?
- **All**: Multiple factions are tracking them. How did they coordinate?

## DM Notes
- This encounter is meant to be overwhelming and cinematic
- Don't kill PCs, but make them feel the danger
- Each attack ties to major arc plot threads
- Success should feel earned but costly
- Failure (especially Yanaba captured) opens new story possibilities
- Adjust difficulty based on party resources and recent encounters

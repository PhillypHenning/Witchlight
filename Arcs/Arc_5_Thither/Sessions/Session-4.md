# Arc-5, Session-4

# Planning

## Recap
The Starved Goblin Casino welcomed you with warm lights and cold promises. Security stripped your weapons at the door, and when Di was flagged by their enchanted detection stone, the party split—some to the bar, others held back in tense negotiation. Velisara, the succubus owner draped in liquid gold, made Di an offer he eventually accepted: information about Chopaign in exchange for the archdevil's true eye color. Di hesitated. Then, when his luck ran dry at the tables and his starvens turned to dust, Caldrien appeared with that perfect smile and offered fifty starvens—if Di would sign the same contract. Di relented and signed. Yanaba watched the first deal from the shadows. The casino knows more than it should.

Meanwhile, Tilly Tumbleweed—one of the missing Witchlight staff—flies erratically around the Devil's Dice table, laughing too loud, winning too much, her pixie dust sparking with stress she doesn't recognize. She gave you starvens freely, generous in her intoxication, but shows no sign of wanting to leave. Two more staff members remain hidden somewhere in this den of beautiful devils and cruel games: Grimble the goblin, and "Lucky" Marlon, but can his luck hold?

The casino hums around you. Music wraps itself around your thoughts. Dealers smile with teeth too white. Every win feels hollow. Every loss feels inevitable. You came here to rescue the lost, but the longer you stay, the harder it becomes to remember why leaving matters at all.

The house always wins. The question is: what will it cost you to prove otherwise?

## Beats
1. **Starved Goblin Casino**
   a. **Continued Casino Activities** — Gambling, exploration, NPC interactions
      - Blackjack rules adjusted — see Reminders
      - Sinner's Weight saves trigger each hour (track secretly)
   b. **Finding Grimble** ([Starved-Goblin-Casino.md](../../../Worlds/Prismeer/Thither/Locations/Starved-Goblin-Casino.md))
      - Muffled sobbing from locked stall — Grimble won't open initially
      - Kravik (floor Bearded Devil) is actively patrolling nearby — complication
      - Owes 23 starvens — party must pay, distract security, or smuggle him out
   c. **Finding Marlon** ([Starved-Goblin-Casino.md](../../../Worlds/Prismeer/Thither/Locations/Starved-Goblin-Casino.md))
      - Velvet ropes, guarded by Shenax (Bearded Devil)
      - Charmed by Caldrien — Insight DC 18 to notice; Remove Curse / Dispel Magic to break
      - 89-starven debt still stands even after charm broken — Caldrien won't let him walk
   d. **Maurnu Appearance** ([Starved-Goblin-Casino.md](../../../Worlds/Prismeer/Thither/Locations/Starved-Goblin-Casino.md))
      - Enters through employee area, slightly drunk, targets Di or Yanaba
      - Passes a folded note: *"Meet me outside. Walk with me. —M"*
      - Outside (Message cantrip): Tempest, Creak, and 3rd want to meet east of Thither
      - Warning about Sinner's Weight: "Six hours I was here once, before Tempest dragged me out."
   e. **Never Leave Spa Quest Hook**
      - Velisara or Caldrien approaches party privately
      - "Our mutual problem — the spa is stealing our customers."
      - Reward: premium prizes including Polymorph potion (needed for Orphanage infiltration)
   f. **White Bliss Offered to Sevro**
      - Casino escort (Lysara, Thorn, or Vexia) offers during a private moment
      - DC 15 Constitution save or addicted — Craving Debuff activates
   g. **Casino Exit** — Resolving debts, collecting weapons, leaving with staff
      - Tilly: free to leave (paid her own way) — needs Persuasion DC 15
      - Grimble: 23-starven debt must be resolved before Kravik lets him go
      - Marlon: break charm AND resolve 89-starven debt (or Caldrien's "arrangements")
      - Weapons returned on good terms; Yanaba has signed return agreement

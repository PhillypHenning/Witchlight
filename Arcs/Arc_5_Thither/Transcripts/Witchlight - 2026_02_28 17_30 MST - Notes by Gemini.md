### Summary

Negotiations, Tilly Tumbleweed's return, and Sephro's mugging established the party's focus for the Spa mission.

**Tilly Tumbleweed's Departure**  
Carigg successfully persuaded Tilly to leave the casino while ahead 40 stravens, resulting in the retrieval of the first missing Witch Light staff member. Before leaving, Tilly purchased a bag of holding, which served as a memento of their time gambling.

**Sephro's Loss and Revenge**  
Sephro was mugged upstairs for 15 stravens after a payment dispute over a potion that provided no physical benefit. The party decided to refocus their efforts on the Spa, which is the casino's primary competitor and where they believe they can cause significant damage.

**Preparation for Spa Trip**  
The party spent 2 days attempting to secure the final Witch Light employee, who chose to remain in servitude after a massive loss. The group decided to leave the dejected man and travel toward the Spa, only to fail constitution checks and set up camp where they were immediately surrounded by enemies.

## SHELVED

*More details:*

* **Session Recap and Setting the Scene**: The session began with a recap detailing D's agreement with Velisara and Caldron, where they accepted 50 stravens to sign a contract after losing 20 stravens at the blackjack tables ([00:00:00](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ooa6nboqznuo)). The recap noted that Tilly Tumbleweed, one of the missing Witch Light staff, was erratically playing dice, acting generously but showing no desire to leave the casino ([00:01:40](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.y1pr5q2jkyh7)). The party is currently on the gaming floor, near the dice tables with Tilly, and aware that two other staff members, Brimble the Goblin and the Lucky Merlon, remain missing ([00:02:37](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.fvajnetdtqm)).

* **Player Orientation and Positioning**: The group clarified their physical positions on the gaming floor, with D and Yaba hanging out, and the others, including Carigg and Sarin, situated at one of the tables. The discussion also involved locating the tokens for the characters, including an instance where Sephro's token was accidentally revealed ([00:03:33](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.a6q6sm56o09)). The group confirmed Tilly's position at the table, noting that they were still searching for the two other missing Witch Light staff members ([00:04:10](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.o92220ws8jjb)).

* **Clarification on the Arch Devil's Crush**: Phillyp Henning provided additional, previously unshared information to D that Scabatha, the Witch of Games, has a massive crush on the powerful multi-dimensional being, Chopi, who is from a deeper plane of the Hells, called Memphis ([00:04:50](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ccj79wx88qbd)). The group clarified that Scabatha is the witch who owns Tither and is not Bavala or Endlin ([00:06:30](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.p7mnpgh9bzeh)). The speaker reminded the party that they had encountered Scabatha, the creature who flew out of the Witch Light, as recently as a month prior ([00:07:11](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.xs0yiha0p7p9)).

* **Current Casino Atmosphere**: The current atmosphere of the casino was described with the devils and Velisara being absent, while Calisadron's retinue were circulating, offering drinks, and looking for prospects to take upstairs. The table games, cards, and dice were active, and a band was setting up on stage ([00:08:37](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.nq7xl5m3wti3)).

* **Initial Plan to Remove Tilly Tumbleweed**: The party considered how to encourage Tilly Tumbleweed, who seemed to be having fun and winning, to leave. Carigg suggested that they could change the situation and make her leave by ensuring she had nothing left to bet ([00:09:13](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ff84x48488f6)).

* **Failed Attempt at Rigging Blackjack**: The idea of rigging the game of blackjack was quickly dismissed, as blackjack is a house game. Cas Vander Grift then inquired if using spells to manipulate people would result in being kicked out, to which Phillyp Henning replied that they had not seen any rules against it ([00:09:56](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.9bldoggkzqxv)).

* **Observing the Casino Prize Bank**: The group's attention was caught by a large wall behind them, which functioned as a slot bank displaying dozens of potions and items. They realized they could exchange their stravens for these items ([00:10:33](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ljwidbhzsn1p)).

* **Sephro's Intervention with Tilly**: Sephro approached Tilly with the intention of making them "have a bad day" so they would leave and return to work ([00:11:18](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.z36r4flnivo0)). As Sephro attempted to sing a tale to Tilly, a girl described as having blonde hair and a nice little point to their face slid in behind them, interrupting the performance and suggesting Sephro should go upstairs ([00:11:51](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.rg2x5yuauwkm)).

* **Sephro's Departure and the Potion**: After being propositioned by two individuals (a female and a shirtless, glistening male) to go upstairs, Sephro accepted the "limited offer," assuring the group that if they were not back in 20 minutes, their friends should look for them ([00:13:00](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.s3pg8qqqvj7z)) ([00:13:45](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.35jlqkdwwmd5)). On the way upstairs, the female individual handed Sephro a potion, which Sephro immediately chugged ([00:13:37](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.qgbg8arrc8ml)).

* **The Potion's Effect on Sephro**: Upon drinking the bubbly liquid, Sephro felt a cold, slimy sensation as it went down their throat, followed by a fizzy sensation in their head ([00:14:20](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.8s627m0aux3)). When Sephro looked down at their hand, they were no longer perceived as a corpse, appearing whole ([00:14:46](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.iqdiqixr7ud2)).

* **Tilly's Continued Luck and Carigg's Persuasion**: While Sephro was gone, Tilly won another hand of blackjack, increasing their chips ([00:15:09](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.n6kg8cl22x9x)). Carigg attempted to persuade Tilly to leave while they were ahead, reminding them the house always wins and that work offers guaranteed income ([00:16:51](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.vgm1a5z84l6y)).

* **Tilly's Temporary Departure**: Tilly considered Carigg's point, noting they were up 40 stravens and expressed concern about being kicked out. After winning another chip, Tilly announced they would go to the bathroom to think about leaving, effectively removing themself from the tables ([00:15:29](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.oyodcus3kwti)) ([00:16:51](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.vgm1a5z84l6y)).

* **Group Moves to the Item Bank**: With Tilly temporarily out of the way, D, Cas Vander Grift, and Sarin moved over to the item wall to examine the available merchandise ([00:17:23](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.h2iq1ycnfhki)). The selection included potions, scrolls, rods, wands, mirrors, shells, pebbles, ferns, elixirs, weapons, and armor ([00:17:59](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.vfi7jynpk34k)).

* **Item Selection and Transaction Process**: The party noted the items were high quality, with most entry-level merchandise starting around 30 stravens ([00:19:36](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.poprpbld0bri)) ([00:21:39](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.hnoklml53zij)). Two goblins were manning the desk, taking a step back and gesturing at the wall when approached ([00:18:36](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.7q15s7isre)). The process for buying an item involves selecting it from the desk, with the goblins passing it through a small transfer box, and the group noted that many people seemed to have lost their possessions here ([00:21:03](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.vva83y1r1jmj)).

* **Carigg's Sale of Items**: Carigg, only having six stravens, was offered items like a healing potion, a potion of climbing, and first-level scrolls ([00:21:39](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.hnoklml53zij)). Carigg successfully sold a "whispering fern" for three stravens and "goggles of night vision" for eight stravens, and a piece of cheese for two stravens, increasing their total stravens to 17 ([00:25:55](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.db8xsvv42z4z)) ([00:27:17](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.8hzrhwj3yvcz)).

* **D's Sale of Items**: D, who had 30 stravens, inquired about cleansing potions, but the goblins had none ([00:22:57](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ccs4xn1mofax)). D attempted to sell a "fancy key" for three stravens, which the goblins declined, but successfully sold a scroll of blindness and deafness for 12 stravens, although the group later noticed a sign indicating the scroll was worth 25 stravens ([00:23:52](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.wcf0yfhkiurq)) ([00:27:58](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.2ot2qwfg4wzx)).

* **Tilly's Final Departure**: Tilly returned to the item bank, purchased a "bag of holding," and thanked Carigg for the "kind words" that convinced them to leave ([00:30:12](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.od60ecxxrno0)). Tilly referred to the bag as a "nice momento" and headed off, completing the rescue of one of the missing staff members ([00:30:59](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.69023yv7yp9y)).

* **Caldron's Inquiry**: Caldron approached Sarin, inquiring about the group's next move and where they were headed, specifically asking if they planned on going to the spa. Caldron explained that Velisara would compensate the party if they managed to "disrupt our competition," the spa, where customers often return with fewer body parts ([00:33:56](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.mmznzdp6yeeh)) ([00:36:00](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ox9diagoqfrq)).

* **Identifying the Group's Decision Maker**: Sarin indicated that Yaba was likely the decision maker, but Caldron was confused because Yaba had just been exchanging magic items ([00:34:36](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.35qqxaw2rvyr)). Caldron then recalled that Sephro, whom they called "the ugly one," was the group's decision maker and was currently "upstairs enjoying himself" after being given a potion ([00:36:00](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ox9diagoqfrq)).

* **Sephro's Non-Eventful Time Upstairs**: While Sephro was upstairs, they did not feel anything, even though they were surrounded by bodies and the temperature was hot. Sephro was internally frustrated that the potion seemed to have no effect on them ([00:38:58](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.16xqx2oifuz5)).

* **The Prostitutes' Fee and Failed Negotiation**: Seo attempted to leave after a dispute with the prostitutes over payment, who claimed they were owed five starvens each, totaling nine after a proposed discount ([00:39:40](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.2lh201nb87ev)). When Seo objected to the payment, a man blocked the door and threatened to call security ([00:41:21](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.k3s6zt7pm0vh)). A massive man named Gorax arrived and, after hearing the situation, declared the total payment was 12 starvens ([00:42:11](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ty2bj7hsxsgc)).

* **Confrontation with Gorax and Forced Payment**: Seo attempted to resolve the dispute with Gorax by suggesting a game of high card, low card, betting 12 starvens ([00:43:11](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.dn4pncdav5lj)). Gorax immediately attacked Seo with brass knuckles, breaking Seo's nose and dispelling an illusion, causing Seo to hit their head and fall to the ground. Gorax then took 15 starvens from Seo, giving 12 to the prostitutes and keeping three for themself ([00:44:09](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.4gxql8xpq5a)).

* **Seo's Outrage and Plan for Revenge**: Seo left the room, found D, and expressed outrage over being robbed, declaring they would "torch this whole place" ([00:45:00](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.3f6wa93uv1fz)). D attempted to calm Seo, suggesting that the prostitutes and the casino were involved in a "big ruse" designed to get people to visit the spa ([00:45:51](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ucbc0hvd4hgr)). The group resolved to target the spa, which they believe is where the casino can be hurt ([00:46:39](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.mxzjtbpo2ykc)).

* **Seo's Remaining Funds and Offer to D**: Seo confirmed they were down 50 chips after the robbery and planned to go make more ([00:46:39](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.mxzjtbpo2ykc)). D offered Seo five chips to help them, but Seo declined and instead suggested that D take Seo's remaining 50 chips to put them to "good use". D was hesitant to take the risk of having Seo leave without any funds ([00:47:26](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.uo5cebgbvwgv)).

* **Casino Rule on Chip Transfers**: As the scene ended, the camera focused on the casino rules, stating that players "cannot pass chips to another player full stop dot". This revealed that Seo's offer to give D 50 chips was prohibited by the casino's rules ([00:48:29](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.atdq7q5od1fk)). Phillyp Henning confirmed that they would not allow Seo to simply give their funds away ([00:49:38](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.j0sfflcv2gcf)).

* **Player Decisions on Cashing Out**: Yennea expressed distrust of the situation and decided to cash out before searching the bathroom, being done with gambling. Carrick, Sarin, and Yennea all decided to cash out their winnings ([00:50:14](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.5f95hagvo6mm)). Carrick gained 17 total chips, being up seven ([00:51:04](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.wbzodse22nci)).

* **D's Attempt to Acquire More Chips**: D was short two chips for a positive ability point gain, possessing 42 starvens ([00:51:43](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.eyzj6kkl6k4n)) ([00:53:05](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.kjhmq9p7bp4b)). D tried to sell a key to the two goblins that previously bought a scroll from them, but the goblins would only offer one starven for it. D refused the one starven offer, needing two chips to round up their total ([00:52:19](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ad3dau8t9s2u)).

* **D's Roulette Gamble**: Emily C suggested D play another game of blackjack, but D decided to go to the roulette table instead ([00:53:05](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.kjhmq9p7bp4b)). D placed two chips on "even," which pays one to one ([00:53:52](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.kh93hlyq7b1e)). The roulette ball landed on 17, an odd number, resulting in D losing the two chips ([00:54:47](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.s7q7xqy73zz6)).

* **D's Final Chip Total and Ability Point Gain**: D, who had already set aside 33 chips, ended up taking out the remaining seven from their initial 42, losing another gamble ([00:55:23](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.qugtad4tdp7)). After subtracting the lost amount, D's final chip total was 33 starvens, resulting in a plus three ability point gain ([00:56:15](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.woc5lngfvnfj)).

* **Clarification on Ability Score Costs**: Daniel Monteiro realized that D's initial cost for the two ability points was 11 chips each, meaning they needed more chips than anticipated to cover the cost ([00:56:47](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.fis7bwr5im5e)). Phillyp Henning clarified that everything cost 11 chips, describing it as a tax or a house fee, similar to how casinos take a rake from poker hands ([00:58:44](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.b4nbvt9o0lz5)).

* **Ability Point Allocation and Seo's Penalty**: Yennea, Carrick, and D all accepted their earned ability point increases ([00:56:47](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.fis7bwr5im5e)). Yennea put their plus one point into wisdom, and Carrick put theirs into charisma ([01:06:36](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.301lc3boctio)). D put their plus three points into Constitution, which would immediately give them a plus two modifier ([01:07:32](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.thrnz2memz1l)). Seo was penalized five ability points, which they would minus across all their top ability scores except charisma ([00:58:12](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.nx57yks45f0z)) ([01:08:03](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.uoqnrsurhse)).

* **D's Second Attempt to Sell to Goblins**: D returned to the goblins with a better offer, proposing a first-level scroll spell for two starvens and something off the wall. The goblins accepted the offer, exchanging two starvens and a "mystery item" for the scroll ([01:00:00](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.f8zjsolc0wrw)) ([01:03:08](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.gp5r8znyop9g)).

* **Discovery of the Mystery Item**: Upon receiving the mystery item, D performed an investigation check ([01:04:33](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.3bxzjs90xysg)). The item smelled like "two week old belly button" and had the consistency of old wet Play-Doh; it was revealed to be a large wad of gum. The goblins claimed it was a year's worth of collecting ([01:05:01](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.f78yy6tj1mci)).

* **D's Storage of the Wad of Gum**: D took the wad of gum and stashed it for the moment, putting it in their "armpit pouch" in their shell ([01:05:42](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.4z9gqyqrb9a)). The group joked that the turtle had an "armpit pouch" for storage ([01:06:13](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.1leosrgvom4k)).

* **Ability Point Assignment Mechanics**: Phillyp Henning clarified that the ability point gain was a plus one to the ability score itself, not the modifier ([01:06:13](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.1leosrgvom4k)). They instructed the players to create a passive effect in their character sheet to track the source and allocation of the bonus ([01:06:36](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.301lc3boctio)).

* **Reflection on Seo's Narrative Arc**: Phillyp Henning expressed appreciation for the story arc of Seo, describing it as "the fall of a man," who has essentially given up in life. They noted that Seo handles being the "butt of the joke" with an "amazing stride" ([01:09:17](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.up4r3tiomfpw)).

* **The Group Takes a Break**: The group decided to take a 10-minute break ([01:09:38](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.wsgg04p9ockf)). During the break, the conversation shifted to a discussion of a Canadian CGI cartoon show called \*Reboot\* and other childhood animated programs ([01:16:44](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.8grafy4aa58l)) ([01:18:46](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.4deq08saoxxt)).

* **The Phineas and Ferb Discussion**: The conversation begins with a lighthearted exchange attempting to recall the names of characters who rarely speak in a particular show, identifying the characters as Perry and one of the brothers, Ferb, not Herb. The speakers collectively correct the name to Ferb from the show \*Phineas and Ferb\* ([01:20:39](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.jnel7cgjsw0m)).

* **Spongebob and Brain Rot**: The topic shifted to discussing the impact of \*Spongebob\*, with Phillyp Henning and Travis suggesting that the show, particularly the first three seasons, is the reason their generation has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). They agree that \*Spongebob\* is an incredibly funny show that holds up well when watched as an adult, but they also refer to it as the "definition of brain rot" when they were children ([01:21:13](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.l1tpfbekorj0)).

* **Caillou and Poor Morals**: Travis brings up \*Caillou\* as another show they were hesitant to let their children watch, which leads to a consensus that \*Caillou\* is not a good show. Phillyp Henning and Travis agree that the character is a "spoiled brat" with some of the worst morals that could be instilled in a child, asserting that parents should not let their children watch it ([01:21:32](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.wa9ui66zfctc)).

* **The Appeal of Magic School Bus and Arthur**: Daniel Monteiro mentions they were a fanatic of \*Magic School Bus\*, which Phillyp Henning and Travis affirm they liked. Phillyp Henning also liked \*Arthur\*, specifically noting that they would listen to the intro to \*Arthur\* whenever they had the chance because it was a "Jamaican song" ([01:21:59](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.lt1a8ri66lln)). The song is identified as being performed by Bob Marley's son ([01:22:26](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.cpqv2xr99d2l)).

* **Fairly OddParents and a Dark Ending**: The speakers discuss \*Fairly OddParents\*, where Travis mentions a clip of the last episode where the main character apparently wished to be 10 forever. Phillyp Henning and Sydney Bruce characterize this ending as "really dark," with Cas Vander Grift suggesting the wish was intended to keep the show going forever ([01:22:48](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.fdb1w7wn2yn8)).

* **The Creator of Danny Phantom**: The conversation turns to the creator of \*Fairly OddParents\*, who also created \*Danny Phantom\* ([01:22:48](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.fdb1w7wn2yn8)). Travis expresses dislike for \*Danny Phantom\*, while Cas Vander Grift and Daniel Monteiro recall liking it. Emily C points out that the concept of \*Danny Phantom\*, where a character gets trapped in a science experiment and becomes half-ghost, is "messed up as hell" ([01:23:18](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.a5tsktqi4kf2)).

* **Recalling What's with Andy**: Daniel Monteiro asks if anyone watched \*What's with Andy?\* and identifies the character as a prankster. Travis mentions the character had spiky hair and "looked like a football," leading Phillyp Henning, Sydney Bruce, and Cas Vander Grift to recognize the show ([01:23:37](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.erwm591yo896)).

* **Ed, Edd n Eddy**: Phillyp Henning shifts the topic to \*Ed, Edd n Eddy\*, asking if anyone knows the show, which they praise as "amazing" and "so good". The main goal of the current session, which is \*Dungeons and Dragons\* (D\\\&D), is then brought up ([01:22:26](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.cpqv2xr99d2l)) ([01:24:25](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.1kwcpgi205bh)).

* **The Horror of Courage the Cowardly Dog**: The character of Courage the Cowardly Dog is mentioned, which the speakers agree was "great" but gave them "weird vibes". Emily C mentions a fun Flash internet game based on the show that existed before Flash was discontinued ([01:24:43](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.tb1n1onduv5y)).

* **Resuming D\&D Activity**: The participants return to the game, with Phillyp Henning setting the scene for the party leaning on the bar after exchanging magic items and deciding what to do next. Yennea plans to check on who died in the bathroom, Sever is set on burning down the spa, and Carig decides to look for more signs of "witch light people" ([01:25:21](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.hom22u1dt073)).

* **Clarifying the Target of Destruction**: Phillyp Henning seeks clarification on Sever's target, which is confirmed to be the spa, not the casino, based on D's instruction ([01:27:13](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.jms1uaumha0k)). Sarin decides to join Yennea to check out the "dead people" in the bathroom, while D will accompany Sever on their mission to burn down the spa ([01:28:04](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.xvg0gsj66n59)).

* **Carig's Information Gathering**: Carig decides to talk to the bartender to gather information instead of performing a perception check. Carig successfully uses a persuasion check to ask the bartender if they have seen any workers from the local carnival ([01:28:32](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.wwcfp8ms5ucd)). The bartender points out a previously seen carnival worker, Tilly, and another worker in the "high rollers room," which requires 30 starvings to enter ([01:29:26](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.1dzwlof9jvt8)).

* **Investigation in the Bathroom**: Yennea and Sarin enter the bathroom, which is calm, still, and well-lit with mirrors and stalls ([01:30:08](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.x43sp5qf8e2d)). A perception check reveals that Yennea hears "very, very quiet sobbing" coming from the back ([01:31:04](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.aymdlk6nn2c)). Yennea asks the person in the stall if they are okay, and the voice identifies themself as a concerned patron trying to quickly raise 23 starins because they are in a tight spot ([01:32:16](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.h33trk9lj9ym)).

* **Encounter with the Goblin in the Stall**: The person in the stall, a goblin, confirms they lost money in blackjack and their "only talent" is being good with their hands, which they are going to have to "pay with" ([01:33:20](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.7v1i61pwido)). Yennea fails a persuasion check to convince the goblin, who keeps sniffling ([01:34:09](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.j26qsdgfiy8b)). Yennea attempts to reassure the goblin that they do not need much talent for their Witchlight job, after which the goblin opens the stall door, revealing they are a mess ([01:35:12](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.l1mg5d9brkgw)).

* **Helping the Goblin**: The party debates how to help the goblin pay off their debt of 23 starins. Emily C gives the goblin one leftover starin, reducing the debt by one ([01:36:08](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.cxw0yqn3z1or)). The goblin expresses gratitude and leaves, with Yennea following them out ([01:36:59](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.wakow8dfh67p)).

* **Sever's Deceptive Plan and Realization**: Sever and D leave the casino, with Sever acting casual and rearming themself ([01:37:43](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.vl294eo18gb9)). Sever is confronted by Moranu, and upon realizing the spa is not part of the casino but a journey away, Sever is defeated, expressing feelings of being "hurt, betrayed, \[and\] manipulated" by D ([01:39:20](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.azb3zfj96mw)). D clarifies they thought Sever knew the spa was not connected and was trying to cover their bases before they had to "pay up" due to a deal they made ([01:39:51](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.au5g7u3akvuv)).

* **Moranu's Reappearance and Goals**: Moranu approaches Carig and informs them that their friend Tempest is with their brother in the playhouse ([01:41:21](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.rhqrpu5pakt7)). Moranu confirms they are "burning time" and keeping their distance because others "don't like them all too much" ([01:42:29](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.2en4x094mnl0)). Moranu asks the party about their plan, and after the party mentions they are looking for Witchlight employees, Carig points out the third employee in the high roller's room ([01:43:20](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.13wrufewhj8)).

* **Private Conversation with Moranu**: Moranu invites Yennea for a private walk away from the casino, which Yennea accepts after picking up their weapons ([01:44:22](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.d58j0l9j65k1)). Moranu leads the party into the forest of Tither to a spot away from the casino and asks about their overall plan ([01:46:10](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.dsg3dvtwel8q)).

* **Party Goals and Moranu's Concern**: The party reveals they are searching for a missing bugbear and a unicorn or their wife, while Sever still wants to burn down the casino or the spa ([01:47:26](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.kylec4euonwd)). D and Sarin note confusion and horror on Moranu's face, while Sever, Carig, and Yennea only perceive excitement or have "no idea" what she is thinking ([01:48:13](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.rk8cqprvhtui)). Moranu seems confused that the party is merely doing "odd jobs" for the Witchlight Carnival and asks why they would stay in Tither ([01:49:46](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.amszncjjaqme)).

* **The Hourglass Coven and Future Alignment**: Moranu expresses surprise that the party is not on a "big quest" or planning to eliminate the "Hourglass Coven," which they confirm is the name for the witches ([01:51:12](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ol5wc45886ck)). Moranu states that the party has a "long way" to go and hopes their goals will align in the future, refusing to influence the party ([01:51:42](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.lg6nsqpu8jds)).

* **Moranu's Agreement and Trust**: Moranu reveals their immediate goal is to get their friend back from Bav Baborna, who is at their hut near the frog people's place, which requires getting Tempest down ([01:52:32](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.fu1mmkef5zca)). Moranu states they made an agreement to serve the coven until a specific goal is met, in return for their friend's return. Moranu confirms they work with Tempest but trusts the party, suggesting they might share details of the deal in the future ([01:54:39](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.oj2n0ogltnnt)).

* **Planning to Wait for the Last Employee**: Moranu departs, heading back toward the casino ([01:56:14](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.iqu0wumymi6o)). The party decides to wait for the last Witchlight employee, who is still in the high roller's room. Sever and D sit down outside to play blackjack, betting with gum ([01:57:08](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.si1x1ebtlkf1)). D offers Sever a piece of gum, which is full of "bacteria and viruses," which Sever's zombie immune system successfully fights off ([01:57:49](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.u78vcscyj75k)) ([01:59:51](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.uwilg7rvsxmf)).

* **Decision to Set Up Camp**: The party confirms they do not know the exact location of the spa, only that it is south, and decides to set up camp outside the casino to wait for the last employee to emerge ([02:00:43](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.dr37snrderwj)). The night passes uneventfully ([02:01:36](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.nry19970txjl)).

* **Checking for the Last Employee**: The following morning, Sever volunteers to go inside to check on the last employee ([02:02:19](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.tozvm1m54et0)). Sever hands over their weapons to security before entering the casino ([02:03:36](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.mulvbkxdhieb)). After about a day and a half, the witch light guy comes out of the VIP room, looking dejected and visibly older ([02:04:34](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.xdlmn3mmrsx3)).

* **Approaching the Dejected Employee**: The witch light employee leaves the VIP room looking dejected and slumped over ([02:04:34](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.xdlmn3mmrsx3)). Sever approaches the man, introduces themself, and states that they are there to get the employee "back where you need to be" ([02:06:14](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.h6qtup38vg5r)). The man stares at Sever, and Sever fails a persuasion check. The man responds only with, "I don't have anything to give, bud" before the conversation ends ([02:07:08](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.97geds4ue6su)).

* **Encountering the Wish Light Employee**: Travis brought a dejected old man, identified as a Witch Light employee, to the rest of the group after a brief private exchange ([02:07:53](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.47b6fwech96t)). The man explained that they sold themself into servitude after a VIP game where they lost everything, including beyond the positives into the negatives, and they expressed that they would not be returning to the Witch Light ([02:08:30](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.h5ji4iu6cpca)). The employee then stated that they had no debt to the Witch Light, claiming they only worked there out of generosity, and told the group to inform Mr. Witch and Mr. Light of their status ([02:09:13](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.pn6luxgn3bi7)).

* **Discussion of the Contract and Debt**: The group discussed the employee's predicament, with Travis suggesting a forceful solution to end the man's 15-year term immediately, while Emily C offered to try and help them get out of the servitude ([02:09:13](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.pn6luxgn3bi7)). Cas Vander Grift and Emily C acknowledged that the employee signed a contract and that getting involved was questionable, though Travis suggested they obtain the contract to potentially nullify it with a pre-existing contract ([02:10:47](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.5nt0f0gck6me)). The group collectively acknowledged that the man was seemingly content with their fate and made the decision to leave them ([02:11:40](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.1kb5uevdf1jv)) ([02:39:48](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.qn4ul2q4wdik)).

* **Moving to the Spa and Missing People**: After the encounter, the group agreed to leave the employee and continue their mission, with Emily C reminding the others that they were still missing two people from the original group of six ([02:11:40](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.1kb5uevdf1jv)). Emily C asked a security guard for directions to the spa, which they provided, detailing a route to head west to a river, and then south following the river ([02:12:23](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.hstgfssm6zqp)). The group agreed to start walking immediately, though they noted the time of day was late afternoon, transitioning into evening ([02:12:58](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.fkr82n8p3xjx)).

* **Pushing Travel and Establishing Camp**: The characters decided to push their travel into the evening and early morning, which required constitution checks to avoid exhaustion. After Yannaba and D failed the constitution check, the group was forced to stop and set up camp for a long rest, which resulted in a sluggish setup before they fell asleep. The group then performed D20 rolls, presumably to determine their state after the long rest ([02:13:53](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.xu5p24mh1dt5)) ([02:15:12](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.gf464zorfrsp)).

* **Severero Attempts to Cook Breakfast**: Severero was the first to wake up and attempted to make breakfast using rations, two muffins, and some cotton candy, but the food was completely burned and charred, with the cotton candy caramelized and turned black ([02:16:52](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.vbfmcdbq8m04)). When Severero tried to address D, they realized they could not recall D's name, only referring to them as "turtle guy" or "reptilian" ([02:17:38](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ozp77gilr9c8)). The rest of the party also realized they could not remember D's name, even though they remembered every detail of their time together ([02:19:16](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.7w1d28fpajsl)).

* **Addressing the Amnesia and Naming D**: The group addressed the sudden amnesia regarding D's name, with Emily C suggesting that D had been cursed and should try to cast magic on themself, like a detect spell ([02:20:15](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.e42suwhv6rg2)). D did not feel different and pondered if a name was necessary, feeling free and unconstrained ([02:21:07](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.lo9upjiclpr9)). Cloberclaw suggested the name "Patunia," which D liked and agreed to be called "Pete" for short ([02:21:55](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.gh81h2dgkpef)).

* **Continuing Travel and Constitution Checks**: After breakfast, the group continued their journey west, and Phillyp Henning requested another round of constitution checks to see if they could continue pushing through the evening. The checks failed, indicating they were stumbling in the dark, and someone suggested lighting a torch to provide visibility ([02:23:38](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.vftgk5ypxrm1)) ([02:25:34](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.imd118lf7eac)). Carrick lit a torch, which provided bright light for 15 feet and dim light for 30 feet ([02:26:45](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.3tb6s14xr708)).

* **Discovering a Massive Molt**: While searching for a place to sleep, the group discovered something large, black, and hard, identified as the molted shell of a massive spider with large bear-like claws ([02:27:50](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.edh9cxdwcob5)) ([02:30:14](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.iat7s8oohyp8)). After Cas Vander Grift successfully performed an investigation check, D pulled out a blue flame torch and handed it to Severero, and Cas Vander Grift ritual cast "speak with animals" ([02:29:15](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.msl4hbfzrcec)). The group determined the object was a massive, still spider molt, with an opening that allowed entry into the carcass ([02:30:14](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.iat7s8oohyp8)).

* **Investigating the Molt and Collecting Silk**: Inside the molt, Carrick observed small maggots feeding on the remaining remnants of the creature. Sarin collected spider silk by winding it onto four sticks after successfully performing an athletics check to climb onto the leg of the carcass ([02:32:11](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.7zlgdanla89c)). Carrick, standing at the entrance with a torch, saw the maggots back up from the light. D suggested the husk would make a good shelter, possibly by taking cover under the leg ([02:34:25](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.5lfghdrl5fae)).

* **Realization of Being Surrounded**: Yannaba performed a perception check and heard a snap, something running toward them, and something whipping by at an ethereal speed, causing them to realize the group was surrounded ([02:35:18](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.pv3u1l4cda3t)). Yannaba pulled out their bow, and Cas Vander Grift pulled out their sword, holding the torch with their other hand ([02:37:27](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.buc73ptwt6c3)) ([02:40:40](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.m4kaz013hyqd)). D pulled out their scimitar and positioned themself toward the sleeping Seo ([02:41:30](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.c81bw5ags760)). The group saw two pairs of yellow eyes to their right, four figures walking toward Seo from the south, and four ethereal black-cloaked figures zipping toward Carrick on the west side ([02:42:22](?tab=t.ljobbwftr7di#heading=h.ya2k8x4yoqbv)).

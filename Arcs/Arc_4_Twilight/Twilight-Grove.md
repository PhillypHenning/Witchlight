- [The Druid (Daa'grin)](../../Worlds/Prismeer/Twilight_Court/NPCs/Daagrin.md)
    - A drow druid named Daa'grin
    - Daa'grin was once a wild magic sorcerer in a life long ago. After a short life of discomfort the man found his way into the Fey where his soul immediately felt at home. He's unsure when he picked up druidism but what he does remember is the stark difference between his initial inate magical abilities and having to fail and learn slow and painfully. Druidism was not easy but now a magically increased lifetime later he has become a fine druid.
    - Daa'grin found the Rot Wright Grove after returning to find his friend King Gloam. The grove was a place of cheer and kindness, he was horified to see its current state.
    - He is unable to assist as the magical energy leaking from the Slumbering Dragon's containment spell interacts poorly with the spell he has prepared to cure the grove.
    - He will ask for the partys help in removing the Kobolds. He doesn't hold ill-will against them and would rather they find an ammicable way to remove them, but won't ask questions either
    - Dungeon Knowledge
        - Can tell that there are two oppressive fonts of magic somewhere in the dungeon, one is the sleeping dragon, the other he suspects is the groove.
        - Can tell that there is a dangerous creature lurking somewhere within, he has stayed far away from the North and East as the presence within is revolting
    - Personal knowledge
        - Was a friend of King Gloam, King of the Twilight Kingdom.
        - Though the grove is recognizable, it seems different.. more so than the twisted woods.. he can't put a finger on it but the whole place seems to be a copy of a copy. A xurox of a xurox.

- The Rot Wright Grove
    - Seeded with the blood, anger and war that took place between Zalbina and The Twilight Court the Twilight Grove has been left to fester and rot. The once proud flora now contageous and blighted holds the door closed to The Twilight Court.
    - The largest of the wounded plantlife is the Hanging Tree, a once gorgeous Oak tree was turned into an execution grounds.

# Yanaba (Emily)
I was raised by my family and clan in the depths of the High Forest, with very little contact with the other races. I'm adventuring to discover what is the secret behind my dreams and what the fey wild means to me. And an elder in my clan taught me my trade

- You were raised in a small town in the High Forest by 2 human parents, to whom you were close to. Though the town treated you well, you were always looked at oddly being a Heregon.

- You've been having dreams of the Fey Wilds your entire life

- The elder in you clan was named Sean, he was an expert Hunter whom you trained under for many years. Sean himself was magical, however, he was gifted with animals and tracking, skills which you picked up during your lessons.


Background: Feylost.

## Plans for Yanaba
- Northwind if spoken to will recognize her as a fellow child of the Feywilds and ask why she left
- Agdon and his gang will eventually speak to Emily in Sylvan asking her what's she doing with some material plane brats and ask from where in the Feywild is she from
- Reveal somewehere that she was the unfortunate result of a bad fairy joke. Her birth parents are alive in Thither. She was swapped with a human baby at birth as a cruel joke by Pixies.


# Sevro (Travis)
- He was born in a small village of music. Where he grew to be one of the great sounds around.

- His father was also a famous bard known for some of the most upbeat tunes.

- His father taught him every thing from sitting to playing to shitting. Unfortunately Sevro's father dies when he is a teenager leaving him only his lute witch he had to sell to pay off his father's debt

- His mother ended up dating Sevro's bully after his father passed. During this time he would berate Sevro and assuse him for anything and everything. 

- Sevro did tried to play again, but he now worried more about money than the music. His music was tasteless and the people came at him scaring him and forcing him to leave his village. 

- He now travels and only play when he's truly moved to do so emotionally

Background: Helping an old friend.

- What did Madryck help them with in the past?
- What would they want from Madryck in return for helping him?

## Plans for Sevro
- In the Feywild a storm will form over Sevro and begin raining on him
- His intense emotions will be a beacon within the Feywilds

# Di (Dan)

**Class:** Warlock (posing as Cleric)
**Patron:** Chopaign, one of the Six Night Shades of Cania

## Background

Di originally trained as a cleric but made a desperate pact with the pit fiend Chopaign to save his friend Sevro's soul. Under false pretenses—claiming to sell his own cleric soul—Di became a warlock bound to one of the most powerful entities in the Nine Hells.

## Current Situation

- **Soul Contract Chain**: Di's patron Chopaign holds Sevro's soul for eternity (after Mr. Hat's 1000 years)
- **False Identity**: Party may not know he's a warlock, believes he's a cleric
- **Molten Scimitar**: Wields a weapon with a snake eye, gift from Chopaign
- **Under Surveillance**: Chopaign watches Di's progress and expects updates
- **Mission**: Encouraged by Chopaign to kill the Hourglass Coven witches and locate Skabatha's lair

## Chopaign - The Night Shade

**Title:** One of the Six Night Shades of Cania
**Type:** Pit Fiend
**Domain:** Operates within the walls of Mephistar (8th Layer of the Nine Hells)
**Power Level:** Among the most powerful fiends in the infernal hierarchy

### About the Night Shades
The Six Night Shades of Cania are an elite group of pit fiends who serve as enforcers, spies, and power brokers within Mephistar, the frozen citadel of Cania. They operate in the shadows of the archdevil Mephistopheles's domain, wielding immense influence over contracts, souls, and infernal politics.

### Chopaign's Interest in Prismeer
- Unclear why a pit fiend of such stature has interest in a Feywild domain
- His connection to both Di and Sevro suggests long-term planning
- May have designs on the Hourglass Coven or Prismeer itself
- The casino owners (Velisara and Caldrien) show interest in information about him

### Powers & Abilities
As a Night Shade pit fiend, Chopaign possesses:
- Master-level contract manipulation

- Di is caught between loyalty to his friends and his infernal patron
- Casino security can detect Di's connection to Chopaign (enchanted detection stone)
- Casino owners may offer rewards for information about the Night Shade
- Chopaign's true motives in Prismeer remain mysterious



# Karag (Cas)

“Home” is not a concept known to half-orcs. Karag was cast out from Orc society at a young age, after the passing of his father. The Eyes of Gruumsh thought him weak, defiled by human blood. Karag wandered along the roads of the north with no destination in mind. Food was scarce, he was taught how to fight with sword and shield in hand but he was useless with a bow, so hunting was not an option. Karag instead provided menial labour for the few who would accept it. He was, after all, part orc. Strong and capable but humans, elves and dwarves placed no trust in him out of fear. At night his mind was plagued by a single, burning eye, calling Karag to show them why he should be feared. 

One day in the depths of winter a blizzard fell upon Karag as he traveled. Too far from any town or village he elected to take cover in a nearby cave. But he was not alone. A fire burned softly in the center of the chamber illuminating a simple camp, a large hunk of meat was roasting over the fire. The smell was intoxicating, and Karag hadn’t eaten for at least a day. Besides, the owner of the meal clearly wasn't attending it, he could sneak just a bite. As he approached the fire a stern but calm voice called to him from the darkness of the cave, “I’m willing to share, you need only ask.” Karag turned quickly to see a man dressed in brown robes emerge. “Calm yourself, I mean no harm. I was just paying respects to my god before retiring for the night, but it seems I was not the only one caught in this storm. It appears we will both be forced to remain in this cave awhile, so come. Sit by the fire.”

The kindness of this stranger was foreign to him, clearly this was some sort of trick. What was this “lord” he spoke of? Gods are cruel, unjust and manipulative. But what choice did he have? He was cold and hungry and after a few moments of contemplation he took the man’s offer. As they sat through the night the man told his story. He was a priest traveling south to a temple dedicated to the earth god Grumbar. Grumbar was unshakeable and unchanging, like the very ground on which we stand When the man’s stories ended his attention turned to Karag and his plans. “Plans? I’ve never had any plans that go beyond making it through the night.” The priest gave him a concerned look and, after a long pause, said, “You know, I have quite a long way to go, and there are many dangers on the road for a lone priest. I could use some protection, you look intimidating enough. And you would be compensated well for your troubles.” The decision was an easy one to make, simple work for an honest man. 

After that fateful meeting Karag would make the long trek alongside the stranger to a temple hewn out of a sheer cliff face. There he met with other members of Grumbar’s order. Among them were priests, monks, druids and clerics. They were dedicated to keeping the firm and unchanging tenants of Grumbar the earth god. Karag made the decision to join the order that gave him a sense of stability for the first time in his life. He took “The Oath of Landwalking” and took up arms, joining the order of “Sardonyx Knights” as a holy protector of their ways, fighting against radical and unchecked chaos.

- Seems to be ashamed of his orc heritage
- His life was changed after meeting an old priest of Grumbar who offered him a foreign kindness
- His devotion to Grumbar lead him to take "The oath of landwalking" and join the order of "Sardonyx Knights"

## Ideas for Karag
- What does it take to truly walk away from your heritage?


# Nuff (Weston)
Nuff is an orphan who was adopted by witchlight. He has no idea what happened to his family, but they took him in and he treats everyone there like family.

He got super strong because he's the smallest and had to over compensate. He does not understand much, so he's always heen the perfect tool for his "parents" (mr light and mr creepy). He'll often give them a kiss on the cheek after accepting a task.

Nuff eventually joined the goblin wresling game, and would often be bet on by ticket holders as he participated. As his strength became his beest trait he also offered his muscle to other games hosts to help them set up or do various tasks for them.

He sometimes goes into fits of rage but never remembers them. Whatever happened to his family must have scarred his subconscious....

- Orphaned at a young age, he joined the Witchlight
- Is very affectionate
- He trained his strength in response to positive attention, specifically he's been wrestling goblins for a long while

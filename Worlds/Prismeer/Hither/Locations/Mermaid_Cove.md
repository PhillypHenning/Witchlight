# Mermaid Cove

## Approach — Intro Description (read-aloud)
The swamp path twists unexpectedly, leading you toward the sound of falling water. Moss-covered stones form a natural stairway down into a small hollow where a waterfall tumbles from a rocky outcropping into a pool of surprisingly clear water—a sharp contrast to the murky swamp surrounding it.

At the pool's edge, crabs scuttle across the rocks. Not a few crabs. *Dozens* of them, moving in patterns that seem almost ceremonial. Their claws click in rhythm, and occasionally they bow toward the water as if paying homage to something beneath the surface.

Then you see her: a **mermaid**, pale and dark-eyed, watching you from beneath the waterfall's spray. Her scales shimmer with an iridescent purple-black sheen, and her expression is one of weary amusement—like someone who stopped expecting visitors long ago but isn't surprised when they arrive anyway.

She raises one languid hand in greeting. The crabs freeze, watching you with beady, suspicious eyes.

# Location Overview

## What Is Mermaid Cove?
**Mermaid Cove** is a hidden grotto in Hither's swamps, centered around a waterfall pool that connects to underground waterways. For nearly two decades, it has been the reluctant home of Rain, a mermaid who became trapped here after a magical accident and has long since given up on returning to the sea.

**Key traits:**
- Surprisingly clear water in an otherwise murky swamp
- Underground pool system beneath the waterfall
- Constant sound of falling water muffles nearby sounds
- Populated by a devoted crab cult who worship Rain as a deity
- Rain sells handcrafted jewelry and magical trinkets to visitors

## Why This Location Matters

### To the Swamp's Residents
- **Trading post** — Rain's magical trinkets are prized by those who know where to find her
- **Safe haven** — The crabs discourage most casual predators from approaching
- **Information hub** — Rain sees many travelers; she remembers faces and stories

### To the Party
- **Magical items** — Rain crafts and sells unique water-themed accessories
- **Quest connection** — Rain knows many fey in the region, including Fanny (Jewels' sister)
- **Potential ally** — A mermaid stuck in a swamp may have her own requests...
- **Comic relief** — Larry and his crab cult provide memorable roleplay opportunities

# Navigating the Cove

## The Waterfall Pool
The main pool is about 30 feet across, fed by a waterfall that drops from 20 feet above. The water is deceptively deep—the pool connects to underwater caves that Rain uses as her living quarters.

**Perception DC 12:** Notice the cave entrance beneath the waterfall's base.
**Athletics DC 10:** Swim down to the underwater passage (no check needed for aquatic creatures).

## The Crab Congregation
Crabs cover nearly every dry surface around the pool. They watch newcomers with unsettling attentiveness.

**Speaking with them:**
- Crabs speak Aquan (Comprehend Languages or similar required)
- They are fiercely protective of "the Princess" (Rain)
- They are not inherently hostile but will swarm perceived threats

# Key NPCs

## Rain (Reign) — The Goth Mermaid

### Appearance
Rain has pale, almost porcelain skin contrasted by dark, kohl-rimmed eyes and deep purple-black scales. Her hair is long and black, tangled with shells and small crystals. She wears jewelry of her own making—coral earrings, bone rings, and a choker made of fishbone.

### Personality
- **Resigned** — She stopped believing she'd escape decades ago
- **Sardonic** — Her humor is dry, often self-deprecating
- **Artistic** — She channels her frustration into crafting jewelry
- **Lonely** — Despite the crabs, she craves actual conversation

### Backstory
Rain ended up in Hither after a "freak accident" one night while out partying with friends—including Fanny, the sister of Jewels the satyr. The exact nature of the accident is unclear (even to Rain), but she suspects it involved wild magic, too much fey wine, or both.

She's been trapped in these pools for nearly two decades. The waterways don't connect to any body of water large enough for her to navigate to freedom, and the swamp itself is hostile to aquatic creatures who leave the water.

### What She Knows
- **Fanny** — Rain has seen Fanny recently; she stopped by a few days ago but didn't say where she was headed next
- **The Swamp** — Rain knows Hither's waterways intimately and can describe safe passage routes
- **Bavlorna** — She knows to avoid the hag and her cottage at all costs

### What She Sells
Rain creates and sells magical trinkets to the rare visitors who find her:

| Item | Effect | Price |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Coral Ring of Calmed Emotions** | The wearer becomes completely calm; cannot feel anxiety or become angry | 25 gp |
| **Polished Stone of Blinding Light** | One-time use; 2-foot radius flash stuns creatures for 1 minute (ends on damage or Help action) | 15 gp |
| **Fishbone Choker** | Wearer can breathe underwater | 50 gp |

She also sells crystals, polished stones, and decorative shell jewelry for 1-10 gp each.

## Larry — Self-Proclaimed King of Crabs

### Appearance
A giant crab significantly larger than the others—about the size of a large dog. His shell is barnacle-encrusted and scarred, and he moves with exaggerated importance.

### Personality
Larry is loud, pompous, and speaks entirely in third person. He genuinely believes he is the greatest crab to ever exist and that Rain is a goddess who has blessed his people.

### How He Speaks (Aquan)
> "I! LARRY! THE BIGGEST CRAB TO EVER EXIST HAVE SEIZED THE INTRUDER!"
> "NO! NO! I, LARRY, WILL WAIT. YES WAIT. WE GIVE TO THE PRINCESS AND SHE WILL REWARD US!"

### The Crab Cult
Larry leads approximately a dozen smaller crabs who worship Rain as their "watery deity." Twice a week, they gather to dance for her and present offerings of trinkets and shells they've collected.

They are completely devoted and will defend Rain aggressively—though their combat effectiveness against adventurers is limited.

# Encounters & Hooks

## Standard Arrival
When the party first arrives, they likely encounter:
- Crabs watching them suspiciously
- Larry demanding to know their business (in Aquan)
- Rain observing from the water, amused

If the party rescued Jewels previously, he may lead them here to ask Rain about his sister Fanny.

## Possible Encounters

**The Offering Ceremony**
- If the party arrives during one of the twice-weekly ceremonies, they witness the crabs performing an elaborate dance while presenting gifts to Rain
- Rain looks embarrassed but plays along; interrupting earns Larry's wrath

**Giant Crab Attack**
- If the party seems hostile, Larry attacks while smaller crabs swarm
- Rain calls them off unless she genuinely fears for her life

**Trade Negotiation**
- Rain is willing to trade items for stories, news from outside the swamp, or interesting trinkets
- She's especially interested in anything related to the sea or methods of magical travel

## Adventure Hooks

### "The Way Back"
Rain asks the party to investigate whether there's any way to connect her pools to a larger body of water—or to find magical means of transportation. She offers her entire remaining inventory as payment.

### "Fanny's Trail"
Jewels needs to find his sister. Rain last saw Fanny heading toward [location TBD], and the trail starts here. Rain provides what little information she has.

### "The Crab King's Request"
Larry believes Rain is unhappy (she is, but not because of the crabs). He secretly asks the party to bring her something that will make her smile—a specific flower, a message from an old friend, or proof that she's not forgotten by the outside world.

### "Shell Game"
Someone has been stealing from the crabs' offering piles. Larry is furious. Rain doesn't care but Larry insists this is a matter of honor. Investigation reveals a sneaky swamp creature (your choice) has been raiding the offerings.

# DM Notes

## Tone
Mermaid Cove should feel like an unexpected oasis of personality in the oppressive swamp. Rain's dry humor and Larry's absurd bombast provide comic relief, but there's an underlying melancholy to Rain's situation—she's genuinely trapped and has been for decades. Let players feel that contrast.

## Running Rain
- She's helpful but not naive; she's survived alone for twenty years
- She speaks in a low, tired voice with occasional sharp wit
- She genuinely likes visitors but tries not to show it
- If players offer to help her escape, she's skeptical but cautiously hopeful

## Running Larry
- Commit to the bit: Larry is *always* third person, *always* dramatic
- He genuinely loves Rain in his crustacean way
- The smaller crabs echo his statements with variations ("yis yis, good good")
- His threats are delivered with absolute conviction but are mostly bluster

## Scalable Encounters
- **Low stakes:** Roleplay and shopping; Larry provides entertainment
- **Medium stakes:** Crab combat if players are rude; Rain intervenes before death
- **High stakes:** Something in the underwater caves has awakened; Rain needs protection

## Foreshadowing
If the party meets Rain early:
- She mentions Fanny for later Jewels content
- Her knowledge of waterways could prove useful later
- Larry's cult could become allies or comic recurring characters

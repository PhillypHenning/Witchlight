# Long Forgotten Battlefield

## Approach — Intro Description (read-aloud)
The swamp changes here. The water grows shallow, then drains away entirely into cracked, dry earth. Fog clings low—not the warm, wet fog of the marshes, but something cold and still, like the breath of something that stopped breathing long ago.

You see them before you understand what they are: **shapes in the mist**. Helms. Shields. Spear points jutting from the ground at odd angles. As you draw closer, the shapes resolve into the remains of armor—rusted, moss-covered, and very, very old.

This was a battlefield.

Bodies are long gone, claimed by the swamp or by whatever feeds in places like this. But the weapons remain. Swords driven into earth that hardened around them. Shields half-buried like gravestones. Banners reduced to tatters that still flutter on splintered poles, their sigils too faded to read.

The silence here is absolute. Even the insects are quiet.

Somewhere ahead, something catches the dim light—a faint gleam of metal that hasn't succumbed to rust.

# Location Overview

## What Is the Long Forgotten Battlefield?
The **Long Forgotten Battlefield** is the remnant of an ancient war fought between fey kings whose names have been erased from memory. Even the fey don't remember who fought here or why—only that many died, and the land never recovered.

**Key traits:**
- Unnatural silence; sounds are muffled, voices carry strangely
- The ground is dry and cracked despite the surrounding swamp
- Weapons and armor remain preserved by fey magic or curse
- Time feels wrong here—minutes may pass like hours, or vice versa
- The fog never fully lifts, regardless of weather or time of day

## Why This Location Matters

### To Prismeer's History
- **Living scar** — Evidence that even the Feywild knows war and loss
- **Forgotten lore** — Whatever was fought over has been deliberately erased from memory
- **Magical residue** — The intense emotions of battle have soaked into the land itself
- **Warning** — Even fey kings can be forgotten; power is not permanent

### To the Party
- **Treasure opportunity** — Magical weapons and artifacts may still lie among the fallen
- **Historical mystery** — Who were the kings? What did they fight for? Why is it forgotten?
- **Dangerous ground** — The restless dead may not appreciate grave robbers

# Exploring the Battlefield

## The Silence Effect

### Unnatural Quiet
Sound behaves strangely on the battlefield.

**Mechanical effect:**
- All creatures have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing
- Spells with verbal components require a DC 10 Constitution check or fail (the words won't come)
- Thunderous effects deal half damage but sound twice as loud (echoing eerily)

**Narrative effect:**
- Conversations feel muffled, distant
- Your own heartbeat seems deafening
- Sudden sounds (combat, dropped equipment) echo unnaturally long

### The Time Slip
Time moves inconsistently here.

**Survival DC 14:** Navigate the battlefield without losing time.
**Failure:** What felt like 30 minutes was actually 2 hours. Or 10 minutes was somehow 4 hours.

The party may emerge from the battlefield to find:
- The sun in a different position
- Companions who didn't enter wondering where they've been
- Hunger and thirst suggesting they've been gone longer than they think

## Hazards

### Unstable Ground
The battlefield is littered with half-buried weapons, sinkholes, and treacherous footing.

**Dexterity DC 12:** Avoid hazards while moving at normal speed.
**Failure:** Take 1d6 piercing damage from concealed blades, or become stuck in a shallow sinkhole (Athletics DC 12 to escape).

### Lingering Grief
The emotional residue of the battle can overwhelm those who open themselves to it.

**Wisdom DC 13:** Resist being affected by psychic echoes.
**Failure:** Experience a vision of the battle—chaos, fear, rage, the moment of death. You are incapacitated for 1 round and take 2d6 psychic damage. You also gain one fragmented memory that might provide a clue about what happened here.

### The Fog
The fog is not natural and responds to emotion.

- Moves toward sources of conflict or strong feeling
- Parts briefly for those who show respect
- Thickens around those who take without asking

# Points of Interest

## The Moon-Blade Longsword

### Description
Near the battlefield's center, partially buried in the dry earth, a longsword catches the light. Unlike everything else here, it shows no rust. Its blade gleams with a faint silver-blue luminescence, and its hilt is wrapped in leather that has somehow remained supple.

### Finding It
**Investigation DC 12:** Notice the gleam in the fog.
**Arcana DC 14:** Recognize the magical nature before touching it.

### The Moon-Blade
This is a **Moon-Blade Longsword**—a weapon forged in moonlight, connected to the cycles of the moon and the passage of time.

**Properties:**
- +1 longsword (or higher, DM's discretion)
- Glows with dim silvery light (5-foot radius) when unsheathed
- Additional properties tied to moon phases:
  - **Full moon:** Additional 1d6 radiant damage against undead and fiends
  - **New moon:** Grants darkvision 60 feet to the wielder
  - **Other phases:** Standard +1 weapon

**Optional curse/attunement requirement:**
- The sword may whisper memories of its previous wielder
- It may resist being taken from the battlefield without proper respect
- It may remember the war and mistake enemies for ancient foes

### Why It's Here
The Moon-Blade's previous owner fell in this battle. The sword has waited, perhaps for centuries, for someone worthy to claim it—or perhaps it simply refuses to rust away like everything else.

## The Shattered Command Tent

### Description
The collapsed remains of a command tent, its poles snapped and its canvas turned to tatters. Inside, a warped table still holds the remnants of a battle map—carved into wood, depicting territories that no longer exist.

**Investigation DC 14:** Study the map.
**Success reveals:**
- Prismeer looked different before the hags
- The battle was fought over a central location (now lost or transformed)
- Two sigils mark the opposing forces—neither recognizable

### Potential Lore
This could connect to:
- The original fey courts before the Hourglass Coven
- A war that weakened Prismeer enough for the hags to take over
- Lost treasures or locations buried in forgotten history

## The Mass Grave

### Description
At the battlefield's edge, the ground rises in a long mound. This is where the dead were buried—both sides together, enemies in death as they were in life.

**Religion or Arcana DC 13:** Sense the spiritual weight of this place.
**Success:** You understand that disturbing this ground would be... unwise.

### What Lies Beneath
- The dead are at rest, but not gone
- Grave goods were buried with them (treasure, but at a cost)
- The kings themselves may be interred at the mound's center

# Encounters & Hooks

## Possible Inhabitants

**Battlefield Ghosts**
- Echoes of soldiers who died here, repeating their final moments
- Not hostile unless provoked, but can't be communicated with normally
- Some may remember fragments of the war's purpose

**Scavengers**
- Creatures that feed on magical residue or old death
- Rust monsters, crawling claws, will-o'-wisps
- May have been picking through the battlefield for centuries

**The Warden**
- A fey spirit bound to guard the battlefield's dead
- Appears if the party disturbs graves or takes without offering respect
- Can be negotiated with—demands a price for anything taken

**Lost Historians**
- Scholars or fey who seek to uncover what was forgotten here
- May be allies or competitors
- One of them may know more than they should

## Adventure Hooks

### "The Moon-Blade's Memory"
The Moon-Blade contains fragmentary memories of the war. If attuned, the wielder may experience visions—gradually revealing what happened here and why it was forgotten. But something doesn't want this remembered.

### "The Nameless Kings"
A powerful entity (fey lord, archfey, or patron) offers significant reward for learning the names of the kings who fought here. But the names were deliberately erased, and finding them may require delving into dangerous places—or making dangerous bargains.

### "The Unmarked Grave"
Someone claims an ancestor fell in this battle and asks the party to retrieve their remains or a keepsake. Navigating the battlefield, finding the specific grave, and escaping with the prize won't be easy—especially if the Warden objects.

### "The War Resumes"
Something is happening at the battlefield. The ghosts are growing restless. The fog is spreading. And the dead are remembering how to hate. Someone needs to put them back to rest before the war resumes—or learn enough about the original conflict to finally end it.

# DM Notes

## Tone
The Long Forgotten Battlefield should feel somber, haunted, and melancholic—a place where violence happened so long ago that even grief has faded to silence. It's not immediately threatening, but the wrongness of it should be palpable. Think of it as a war memorial in a place where memory itself has been damaged.

## Scalable Challenge
- **Low stakes:** Quick exploration, find the Moon-Blade, encounter a few restless spirits
- **Medium stakes:** Navigate time distortions, deal with scavengers or a protective Warden
- **High stakes:** Wake something that should have stayed asleep, or become trapped in a vision of the war itself

## The Moon-Blade
The Moon-Blade is the primary treasure here, but consider:
- Making attunement require respect for the dead (a short ritual, an offering)
- Building it as a story item that reveals more as the wielder proves worthy
- Connecting it to other moon-themed elements in your campaign

## The Mystery
You don't need to know what the war was about or who the kings were—ambiguity works well for a "forgotten" battlefield. But if you want answers:
- The war was between two fey courts now absorbed into other powers
- The names were erased by the Hourglass Coven to remove rival claims to Prismeer
- One of the kings survived and became something else entirely

## Foreshadowing
If the party visits early, they may:
- Notice the fog but not explore deeply
- Glimpse the Moon-Blade's gleam
- Feel the wrongness and decide to return when better prepared

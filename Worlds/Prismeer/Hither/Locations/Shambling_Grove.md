# Shambling Grove

## Approach — Intro Description (read-aloud)
The swamp gives way to firmer ground as you approach the looming silhouette of **Slanty Tower** in the distance. But between you and that crooked spire lies something unsettling—a grove of trees that shouldn't be moving.

Yet they are.

The **Shambling Grove** stretches before you: a copse of ancient, moss-draped trees whose roots lift and set down like the legs of exhausted giants. They don't move fast—a step every few minutes—but their paths crisscross without pattern, creating a maze that refuses to stay mapped.

Vines hang between them like trip wires. Fungal growths pulse with bioluminescence. And somewhere within, you hear something calling for help.

Behind the grove, barely visible through the shuffling trunks, rises the **Wall of Thorns**—that impenetrable barrier marking the edge of Hither.

# Location Overview

## What Is the Shambling Grove?
The **Shambling Grove** is a cluster of awakened trees—not hostile, but not helpful either. They move according to some ancient rhythm only they understand, endlessly rearranging the paths through the grove.

**Key traits:**
- Trees are ambulatory but slow (move 5 feet every 1d4 minutes)
- Paths shift constantly; Survival checks to navigate change difficulty over time
- Rich in rare fungi, medicinal mosses, and fey residue
- Located just below Slanty Tower, against the Wall of Thorns

## Why This Location Matters

### To Prismeer's Residents
- **Natural landmark** — One of the few consistent features between Hither and the Wall of Thorns
- **Foraging ground** — The ambulatory nature of the trees exposes rare herbs and fungi
- **Hiding place** — The shifting paths make pursuit difficult
- **Warning sign** — Locals know: where the trees walk, the Feywild runs deep

### To the Party
- **Rescue opportunity** — Someone may be trapped within, unable to navigate out
- **Treasure location** — Magical items lie abandoned among the roots
- **Shortcut** — Provides access to the Wall of Thorns and Slanty Tower

# Navigating the Grove

## The Shifting Maze

### Initial Navigation
**Survival DC 13:** Find a path through the grove.
- **Success:** Reach your destination within 30 minutes
- **Failure:** Become disoriented; roll again with DC +2, and spend an additional 30 minutes

### The Tree-Walk Problem
The trees rearrange constantly. What worked before won't work again.
- Leaving markers is useless (the trees carry them away)
- Mapping is futile (the layout changes)
- Clever solutions are rewarded:
  - **Speak with Plants** — Ask the trees to hold still or guide you
  - **Flight/climbing** — Above the canopy, navigation becomes trivial
  - **Speed** — A fast party (dashing) can outpace the tree movements

### Getting Lost
Characters who fail multiple navigation checks may find themselves:
- Back where they started
- At the Wall of Thorns (impassable but revealing)
- Face-to-face with the grove's current "resident" (see Encounters)

## Hazards

### Grasping Roots
Trees don't attack, but their roots spread wide and shift without warning.

**Dexterity DC 12:** Avoid being caught underfoot.
**Failure:** Restrained until you escape (Athletics/Acrobatics DC 14) or the tree moves again (1d4 minutes).

### Hallucinogenic Spores
Some fungi in the grove release spores that cause vivid hallucinations.

**Constitution DC 13:** Resist the effect.
**Failure:** For 1 hour, you have disadvantage on Wisdom checks and may perceive the trees as speaking, threatening, or showing you visions of the past.

### The Wall of Thorns
The grove ends at Prismeer's border—an impenetrable wall of magical thorns.
- Cannot be cut, burned, or bypassed by conventional means
- Attempting to force through deals 4d6 piercing damage and pushes you back
- Fey magic or specific keys (items, names, bargains) may open temporary passages

# Points of Interest

## The Rescue Clearing

### Jewels
Somewhere in the grove, a figure is trapped—lost among the shifting trees, unable to find their way out. This is **Jewels**, a sprite or small fey creature (adjust to your campaign needs) who has been wandering for days.

**Jewels' situation:**
- Exhausted, frightened, but not injured
- Has valuable information about Hither or Slanty Tower
- Will reward rescuers with a secret, a small treasure, or future assistance
- Has been surviving on grove fungi (some of which may have... effects)

**Rescue hooks:**
- The party hears Jewels calling for help
- A sprite messenger asks the party to find their missing friend
- Jewels has something Bavlorna wants, and she's sent agents to retrieve them

## The Abandoned Cache

### Shield of Missile Attraction
Among the roots of a particularly ancient tree lies an abandoned **Shield of Missile Attraction**—a magical shield with a dangerous quirk.

**The Shield:**
- +2 bonus to AC against ranged weapon attacks
- Curse: While attuned, you have disadvantage on saving throws against ranged spells, and ranged weapon attacks are made with advantage against you if you're within 10 feet of another creature
- Previous owner abandoned it after learning the hard way

**Finding it:**
- Investigation DC 14 to spot the glint of metal among the roots
- Nature DC 12 to recognize it's been deliberately hidden
- Arcana DC 15 to sense the curse before attuning

# Encounters & Hooks

## Possible Inhabitants

**Lost Travelers**
- Other wanderers trapped in the grove, ranging from helpful to desperate to dangerous
- Some have been lost for years (time moves strangely here)
- May offer to ally with the party, or may compete for the way out

**Grove Spiders**
- Giant spiders that have adapted to the mobile environment
- Webs stretch between trees and move with them
- Territorial but not aggressive unless provoked

**Awakened Shrubs**
- Smaller plant creatures that follow in the trees' wake
- Curious, childlike, sometimes mischievous
- Can be convinced to guide the party (Persuasion DC 12) in exchange for stories

**Bavlorna's Eyes**
- Will-o'-wisps that observe the grove for the hag
- Report back on anyone who lingers too long
- May try to lead the party deeper into the grove—or out, depending on Bavlorna's current mood

## Adventure Hooks

### "The Jewel in the Grove"
Jewels carries something Bavlorna wants—perhaps a stolen trinket, a secret, or a piece of her own power she shed. The party can rescue Jewels and earn their gratitude, or deliver them to the hag for a different reward.

### "The Walking Trees Remember"
An ancient tree in the grove's center still remembers when Prismeer was whole. If the party can communicate with it (Speak with Plants, druidic magic), it may share lore about the Hourglass Coven or the location of something valuable.

### "The Shield's Previous Owner"
Who left the Shield of Missile Attraction here, and why? Following the trail may lead to a skeleton deeper in the grove, clutching a journal that hints at Slanty Tower's secrets.

# DM Notes

## Tone
The Shambling Grove should feel disorienting and dreamlike—a place where the normal rules of navigation don't apply. It's not immediately dangerous, but the longer the party stays, the more unsettling it becomes. Think of it as a Feywild hedge maze where the hedges have opinions.

## Scalable Challenge
- **Low stakes:** Quick navigation, minor spore exposure, meet a friendly awakened shrub
- **Medium stakes:** Get lost, encounter grove spiders, must negotiate with the trees
- **High stakes:** Racing against time while Bavlorna's agents pursue, or trying to rescue someone before the grove "swallows" them completely

## Connections to Other Content
- The **Shield of Missile Attraction** is a genuine cursed item—consider whether a party member will attune before discovering the downside
- **Jewels** can be a recurring ally or a source of ongoing quests
- The **Wall of Thorns** foreshadows the barriers between Prismeer's splinters; the party will eventually need to cross it

## Foreshadowing
If the party passes through early, they may:
- See the Wall of Thorns and wonder how to breach it
- Notice Slanty Tower in the distance
- Find evidence of other travelers who weren't as lucky

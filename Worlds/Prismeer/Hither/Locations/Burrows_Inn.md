# Limnal's Inn

## Overview
Limnal's Inn is the only tavern and lodging establishment in The Burrows, serving as the heart of the Herrigon community. Located in a cozy burrow near the central Heartroot chamber, it functions as meeting place, news exchange, and neutral ground for travelers and locals alike.

---

## Exterior Description
You hear the inn before you see it—the murmur of conversation, the clink of clay mugs, and a warm amber glow spilling from a rounded doorway carved into the tunnel wall. Above the entrance, a wooden sign hangs from a root: a crude painting of a steaming bowl and a smiling rabbit.

The doorway is sized for Herrigon—medium creatures need to duck slightly to enter, though the ceiling inside rises to accommodate taller guests. Warmth wafts from within, carrying the rich aroma of spices and slow-cooked meat.

---

## Interior Description
The inn is a single large burrow with a low ceiling supported by thick roots that have been polished smooth by countless shoulders brushing past. Tables are arranged in clusters—some carved from stumps, others salvaged from who-knows-where and lovingly maintained.

A long bar of packed earth and polished wood dominates one wall, behind which Limnal works with practiced efficiency. Shelves carved into the earthen walls hold clay bottles, dried herbs, and preserved swamp delicacies in jars of murky liquid.

**Key Features:**
- **The Hearth** — A central fire pit with a clay chimney that vents through the tree above, keeping the room warm and slightly smoky
- **The Bar** — Where Limnal serves drinks and holds court over local gossip
- **Corner Alcoves** — Semi-private booths carved into the walls for quiet conversations
- **The Board** — A cork board near the entrance where notices, jobs, and lost-pet postings accumulate
- **Back Curtain** — Leads to the kitchen and the stairs down to the lodging burrows

## The Innkeeper

### Limnal
**Appearance**: A stout Herrigon with tan fur and perpetually flour-dusted paws. He wears an apron that's seen better days and a welcoming smile that's genuine, if weary.

**Personality**:
- **Hospitable** — Treats all guests fairly who can pay
- **Optimistic** — Sees the good in people, sometimes to a fault
- **Connected** — Hears all the gossip; knows everyone's business
- **Grateful** — Appreciates those who help the community

**Dialogue Hooks**:
- "Welcome, welcome! Sit anywhere—I'll bring menus. Unless you want the gumbo. You want the gumbo."
- "You hear about those minotaurs causing trouble? Third raid this season. Someone ought to do something."
- "The Blue Scarfs? Good folk, mostly. They keep the worst away from our doors."

**What He Knows**:
- All the local gossip and news from Hither
- Who's arrived recently and where they were headed
- Which parts of the swamp are more dangerous lately
- The political tensions within The Burrows

## The Staff

### Pip — Kitchen Help
A young Herrigon barely old enough to work, Pip handles dishes, peels vegetables, and runs food to tables. Eager to please but clumsy—expect the occasional dropped spoon.

### Old Mama Cress — The Cook
An elderly Herrigon woman who hasn't left the kitchen in years. Her recipes come from "before the split," and she guards them jealously. Speaks only in Herrigon and gestures to the kitchen staff.

## Atmosphere

**Ambient Details**:
- Soft amber light from lanterns and glowmoss patches
- The constant low murmur of conversation in Herrigon and Common

- Occasional bursts of laughter or heated debate
- Young kits running between tables until a parent catches them

- **The Old-Timers' Corner** — Elderly Herrigon who gather nightly to reminisce about "the old days"
- **Blue Scarf Youth** — Young gang members who stop in after patrol shifts

## Rumors & Information

Spending time at the inn and chatting with Limnal or other patrons reveals local news:

| d6 | Rumor |

| 2 | "The Blue Scarfs found something in the swamp—won't say what, but Aagron's been in a strange mood since." |
| 3 | "Nizzot's been meeting with outsiders lately. Some say he's looking for a way to contact the other half of our city." |
| 4 | "Stay away from the eastern marshes. Something's been pulling travelers under—not gators, something worse." |

## DM Notes

### Running Limnal
- Always busy—wiping the bar, carrying plates, greeting arrivals—but never too busy to talk
- Offers food before anything else; hospitality is reflexive
- Lowers his voice when discussing anything sensitive (Bavlorna, gang politics)
- Genuine warmth; he's one of the few truly kind souls in Hither

### The Inn as Safe Haven
This is one of the rare places in Hither where the party can truly rest. Use it for:
- Long rest without random encounters
- Information gathering between adventures
- Establishing Herrigon relationships that pay off later
- Downtime activities (carousing, gathering rumors, etc.)

### Scaling Encounters
- **Low Stakes** — Social roleplay, eating, drinking, gathering rumors
- **Medium Stakes** — A fight breaks out between Blue Scarf supporters and critics; party can intervene
- **High Stakes** — The inn is attacked during a raid on The Burrows; party must help defend

### The Gumbo
Limnal is extremely proud of his Gator Gumbo. Any character who praises it genuinely gains advantage on their next Charisma check with him. Any character who insults it... doesn't get served again.

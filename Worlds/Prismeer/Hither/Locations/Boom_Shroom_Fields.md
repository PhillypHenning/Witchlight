# Boom Shroom Fields

## Approach — Intro Description (read-aloud)
The swamp thins unexpectedly. The water goes from murky to merely damp, and the trees—gnarled things that normally lean over you like gossiping elders—pull back as if respecting some invisible boundary.

Then you smell it: not rot, not mold, but something sharp and chemical. Like lamp oil mixed with soil after a lightning strike.

Ahead, the ground rises into a wide clearing carpeted in **mushrooms**. Hundreds of them. Thousands. Caps the size of dinner plates in angry reds and warning oranges, their stalks thick and vein-riddled. They pulse faintly, as if breathing. The air above them shimmers with heat that shouldn't exist in this cold, wet place.

A weathered sign—half-chewed by something—leans at the edge of the field:

**"NO FIRE. NO SPARKS. NO LOUD VOICES."**

# Location Overview

## What Are Boom Shrooms?
**Boom Shrooms** are volatile fungi native to Hither's swamps. They absorb ambient magic from the Feywild and store it as unstable alchemical energy. When disturbed—by fire, impact, or even loud noises—they detonate with concussive force.

**Key traits:**
- Caps glow faintly in low light (soft orange pulse)
- Release spores when stressed (causes sneezing, which can chain-react)
- Highly valued by alchemists, hedge witches, and war-minded creatures
- The larger the shroom, the bigger the boom

## Why This Location Matters

### To Bavlorna's Residents
Information about the Boom Shroom Fields is **highly valuable** to residents of Bavlorna's Cottage and the greater swamp. Uses include:
- **Alchemy ingredients** — volatile compounds for potions and explosives
- **Trap components** — protecting lairs from intruders
- **Currency** — boom shrooms trade well with anyone who needs leverage
- **Weapons** — some creatures harvest them specifically for combat

### To the Party
- **Bargaining chip** — Knowing this location (and sharing it) could buy favors from swamp denizens
- **Resource gathering** — Careful harvesting yields valuable alchemical components
- **Quest hook** — Someone may ask the party to retrieve boom shrooms without revealing why

# Navigating the Fields

## Hazards

### The Chain Reaction Problem
One detonation triggers nearby shrooms. Walking carelessly can set off a cascade.

**Stealth/Survival DC 12:** Move through the field without triggering anything.
**Failure:** One shroom pops. Make a Dexterity save (DC 13) or take 2d6 thunder damage. The noise may trigger 1d4 more shrooms (repeat saves).

### Spore Clouds
Stressed shrooms release irritant spores before detonating.

**Constitution DC 11:** Avoid sneezing.
**Failure:** Your sneeze triggers the nearest shroom.

### The Silence Solution
Creative solutions are rewarded:
- **Silence spell** — Perfect. Harvest at will.
- **Muffled movement** — Stealth advantage if wearing soft-soled boots or padding.
- **Animal handling** — A trained familiar can pluck shrooms without heavy footfalls.

## Harvesting Boom Shrooms

**Successful harvest** (Nature or Alchemist's Supplies DC 13):
- 1d4+1 intact boom shrooms
- Each worth 25gp to the right buyer
- Can be thrown (range 20/60) as improvised weapons: 2d6 thunder damage in 5-ft radius

**Failed harvest:**
- The shroom detonates in your hands
- 2d6 thunder damage, no save
- Every creature within 10 feet must save or set off nearby shrooms

# Encounters & Hooks

## Possible Inhabitants
The fields are too dangerous for permanent residents, but visitors include:

**Harvester Sprites**
- Tiny fey with nimble feet, gathering shrooms for unknown patrons
- Will trade information or shrooms for interesting stories
- Flee immediately if violence threatens (they know what happens next)

**Boom Shroom Guardians** (if you want combat)
- Fungal creatures that have adapted to the volatile environment
- Immune to thunder damage; actually healed by it
- Attack by deliberately triggering chain reactions

**Desperate Alchemist**
- An NPC from The Burrows or Bavlorna's Cottage
- Needs boom shrooms for a cure, a weapon, or a debt
- May hire the party or compete with them

## Adventure Hooks

### "The Quiet Harvest"
A merchant in The Burrows will pay handsomely for boom shrooms—but only if the party can explain how they found the fields. He's mapping valuable locations for someone else.

### "Chain Reaction"
Something is deliberately setting off explosions in the fields at night. Is it sabotage? A territorial creature? Or something worse waking up beneath the fungi?

### "The Boom Shroom King"
Rumors speak of a massive boom shroom at the field's center—cap as wide as a cart, stem as thick as a man. They say it's been growing since the hags split Prismeer. They say if it ever goes off, it'll level everything for a mile.

# Connections

## Nearby Locations
- **The Burrows** — Herrigon city; residents would value knowing this location
- **Bavlorna's Cottage** — The hag may have agents seeking boom shroom supplies
- **Slanty Tower** — Can see smoke from detonations on clear days

## Related NPCs
- **Bavlorna Blightstraw** — Ruler of Hither; boom shrooms fall under her domain
- Merchants and alchemists throughout the swamp

# DM Notes

## Tone
The Boom Shroom Fields should feel tense and absurd—dangerous beauty that punishes carelessness but rewards cleverness. Think of it as a Feywild minefield crossed with a treasure hunt.

## Scalable Danger
- **Low stakes:** Single shroom pops, minimal damage, comedy beat
- **Medium stakes:** Chain reaction threatens party resources
- **High stakes:** Something else is in the field with them, and they can't make noise

## Foreshadowing
If the party learns about boom shrooms early, they might recognize them later when:
- An enemy uses them as traps
- They find a depleted field (someone got here first)
- They need them to solve a puzzle (controlled demolition)

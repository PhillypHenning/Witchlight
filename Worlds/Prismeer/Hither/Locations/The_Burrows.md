# The Burrows

## Approach — Intro Description (read-aloud)
The swamp path rises unexpectedly onto firmer ground, and you notice the trees here grow differently—thicker, older, their roots intertwined like clasped hands. Then you see it: a **massive tree**, split clean in two as if struck by a giant's axe long ago. The halves lean apart like estranged siblings, their exposed heartwood weathered silver with age.

Between and beneath the split trunk, you see movement. Windows carved into bark. Rope bridges spanning the gap. Amber lantern light spilling from dozens of small openings. Smoke curls from chimney-holes, carrying the scent of cooking food—something savory, something almost familiar.

Two figures stand at a gate fashioned from woven roots and salvaged metal: **rabbit-folk**, ears alert, hands resting on weapons. They watch your approach with the wary eyes of people who've learned that strangers rarely bring good news.

# Location Overview

## What Is The Burrows?
**The Burrows** is the underground city of the Herrigon—rabbit-folk who have carved their home into and beneath a colossal split tree in Hither's swamps. It represents the remnants of a much larger Herrigon civilization that was torn apart when the Hourglass Coven split Prismeer into three domains.

**Key traits:**
- Extensive tunnel network beneath and around the split tree
- Warm amber lighting from lanterns and glowmoss
- Population of rabbit-folk ranging from elderly to young families
- Strong cultural memory of "better times" before the split
- Guarded perimeter with young Herrigon sentries

## The Split City
Before the hags divided Prismeer, The Burrows was part of a larger Herrigon city that spanned into what is now Thither. When the domain was split, the city was literally torn in two. The Herrigons of Hither have not been able to make contact with their kin in the other half since the separation.

They tell tales of the grasslands they once had access to—open spaces, clear skies, land that wasn't constantly trying to drown them. Life in Bavlorna's swamp is hard, and the city has shrunk considerably as the swamp claimed more territory.

## Why This Location Matters

### To Hither's Residents
- **Last sanctuary** — One of the few permanent settlements in the swamp
- **Trading post** — Herrigons trade with other swamp denizens for supplies
- **Recruitment ground** — The Blue Scarf Gang draws many of its members from here
- **Information hub** — News and rumors flow through The Burrows

### To the Party
- **Safe haven** — A place to rest, resupply, and gather information
- **Complex politics** — Divided opinions on the Blue Scarf Gang create roleplay opportunities
- **Quest connections** — NPCs here have relationships throughout Hither
- **Cultural context** — Understanding the Herrigon helps understand the region's history

# Navigating The Burrows

## The Gate
The main entrance is a reinforced gate of woven roots and scavenged metal, flanked by guard posts. Visitors must explain their business before being admitted.

**Persuasion DC 10:** Standard entry with a reasonable explanation.
**Failure:** Guards insist on an escort or turn the party away if they seem threatening.

## The Warren
Inside, The Burrows is a three-dimensional maze of tunnels, rooms, and chambers carved into earth and root. Natural light filters through gaps in the tree above, supplemented by amber lanterns and patches of cultivated glowmoss.

**Major areas:**
- **The Heartroot** — Central chamber beneath the split; serves as town square
- **The Inn** — Main gathering place and tavern, run by Limnal
- **The Elder's Den** — Where Nizzot holds court
- **Residential Warrens** — Family homes carved into the tunnel walls
- **The Market Ring** — Small trading circle around the Heartroot

## Getting Lost
The tunnels can be disorienting to non-Herrigons.

**Survival DC 10:** Navigate successfully between major locations.
**Failure:** End up in a residential area, possibly intruding on a family's home.

# Key NPCs

## Nizzot — The Old Mayor

### Appearance
An elderly Herrigon with graying brown fur and clouded eyes that still miss nothing. He wears simple robes and leans on a carved walking stick, though his movements suggest the stick is more habit than necessity.

### Personality
- **Pragmatic** — He's seen too much to be idealistic
- **Thoughtful** — Considers all angles before speaking
- **Tired** — The weight of leading through hard times shows
- **Diplomatic** — Balances competing factions within The Burrows

### Views on Aagron Blue Scarf
Nizzot has a complex opinion of the Blue Scarf Gang's leader:

> "I see Aagron as a neutral force. He has certainly provided help and hope, but at the cost of lives. Though in this swamp, can one ask for more?"

> "I may have joined him had I been a younger rabbit. I likely would have wanted him forgotten about as a father. Today I understand his position is a complex one."

### What He Knows
- The history of The Burrows before the split
- The locations of other settlements in Hither
- Which creatures and factions control different territories
- How to survive in Bavlorna's domain without drawing her attention

---

## Limnal — The Inn Keep

### Appearance
A stout Herrigon with tan fur and perpetually flour-dusted paws. He wears an apron that's seen better days and a welcoming smile that's genuine, if weary.

### Personality
- **Hospitable** — Treats all guests fairly who can pay
- **Optimistic** — Sees the good in people, sometimes to a fault
- **Connected** — Hears all the gossip; knows everyone's business
- **Grateful** — Appreciates those who help the community

### Views on Aagron Blue Scarf
Limnal likes Aagron and sees him as a positive force:

> "Without the Blue Scarfs, we'd have been overrun seasons ago. Aagron keeps the worst of the swamp at bay. Yes, some boys don't come back, but that's the swamp, not Aagron."

### The Inn
Limnal runs the only inn and tavern in The Burrows, serving as:
- Meeting place for travelers and locals
- Source of hot meals and safe lodging
- Unofficial news exchange
- Neutral ground for negotiations

### The Menu
See the full menu below in the Amenities section.

## Urde and Egot — The Frontgate Guards

### Appearance
Two young Herrigons barely into adulthood, wearing blue scarves tied around their necks—marking them as members of Aagron's gang. Both carry crossbows and short swords, kept clean but clearly well-used.

### Personality
- **Eager** — Proud of their positions and responsibilities
- **Nervous** — Still learning; haven't seen real combat
- **Loyal** — Devoted to Aagron's cause and The Burrows
- **Suspicious** — See threats everywhere; err on side of caution

### Role
They represent the younger generation drawn to the Blue Scarf Gang—idealistic, hoping to make a difference, not yet hardened by loss. How the party treats them can affect how The Burrows receives them.

---

## The Ral Family — Voices of Opposition

### Father: Ral
A middle-aged Herrigon carpenter with strong hands and a bitter expression. He doesn't particularly like Aagron, viewing the gang as a symptom of their decline rather than a solution.

### Mother: Areh
A haunted Herrigon woman who **hates** Aagron with quiet intensity. Her oldest boy ran away to join the Blue Scarf Gang last year and died within a month of joining. She holds Aagron personally responsible.

### Children: Elaven and Areh (daughter)
Too young to understand the tensions that divide their community. They play in the tunnels, unaware that their parents' grief shapes their world.

### Why They Matter
The Ral family represents the cost of resistance against the swamp. They provide a counterweight to the pro-Aagron sentiment, giving the party a more nuanced view of the Blue Scarf Gang's impact.

# The Blue Scarf Gang

## Overview
The Blue Scarf Gang is a Herrigon militia/outlaw group that operates throughout Hither, protecting (and taxing) travelers, raiding dangerous creatures, and fighting the swamp's countless threats. Their base is a location called **The Tollway**, separate from The Burrows.

Many young Herrigon from The Burrows join the gang, drawn by:
- Promise of adventure beyond the warren
- Desire to fight back against the swamp
- Aagron's charisma and reputation
- Better weapons and training than The Burrows can provide

## Key Gang Members

### Aagron Blue Scarf — Captain
A white-furred Herrigon with sapphire-blue eyes and a signature blue scarf. Charismatic, cunning, and genuinely cares about protecting his people—though his methods are often violent.

### Grundy — Lieutenant
The strongest Herrigon alive, according to legend. He rides atop a **flail snail** and commands a squad of snail riders. Gruff, intimidating, but respected.

### The Blue Scarfs
Approximately 25-30 Herrigon in total, including brigands, snipers, and snail cavalry. All wear blue scarves as identification.

# Encounters & Hooks

## Standard Arrival

### Peaceful Entry
If the party approaches without hostility:
- Urde and Egot question their business
- Successful Persuasion grants entry with or without escort
- Limnal welcomes them at the inn; Nizzot eventually appears if they stay

### Hostile Entry
If the party threatens or attacks:
- Guards sound alarm horns
- Tunnels fill with armed Herrigon
- Combat in tight tunnels favors the defenders

### During the Minotaur Raid
If arriving at the right time, the party might find:
- Urde and Egot knocked out, stuffed into a nearby crate and barrel
- Screams coming from within The Burrows
- Two minotaur brothers, **Crusher and Bruiser**, raiding the settlement
- The brothers flee after both take significant damage

---

## Adventure Hooks

### "The Split City"
Nizzot asks the party to investigate whether contact with the other half of the Herrigon city (now in Thither) is possible. Reward: Maps of safe passage through Hither, or a valuable heirloom.

### "A Mother's Grief"
Areh approaches the party privately. She wants proof of how her son died—and if Aagron is truly responsible, she wants justice. This puts the party between The Burrows and the Blue Scarf Gang.

### "The Minotaur Problem"
Crusher and Bruiser were sent by Skabatha to meet with Bavlorna, but attacked The Burrows opportunistically. The party can track them back to discover their mission.

### "Fresh Recruits"
Urde or Egot asks the party to accompany them on their first real mission for the Blue Scarfs. A chance to see Aagron's operation from the inside—and to decide whose side the party is on.

### "The Lost Half"
Yanaba, or another Herrigon, has no memory of The Burrows despite clearly being Herrigon. Could she be from the lost half of the city in Thither?

# DM Notes

## Tone
The Burrows should feel like a refuge under siege—warm and welcoming inside, but acutely aware of the hostile swamp pressing in from all sides. The community is tight-knit but divided, with the Blue Scarf Gang a constant source of both protection and controversy.

## Running NPCs

### Nizzot
- Speak slowly, thoughtfully; he's choosing words carefully
- Never completely commits to one side of any argument
- Knows more than he reveals until trust is established

### Limnal
- Warm, bustling, always offering food or drink
- Gossips freely but never maliciously
- Genuinely happy to see new faces

### Urde and Egot
- Young, nervous energy; try too hard to seem tough
- Look to each other for reassurance
- Can be swayed by kindness or intimidated by displays of power

### Areh (the mother)
- Quiet grief that hardens into cold anger when Aagron is mentioned
- Watches the party carefully; looking for allies
- Will not forgive but might work with practical people

## The Blue Scarf Question
The party will eventually need to decide how they feel about Aagron and his gang. Present both perspectives fairly:

**Pro-Aagron:** Without him, The Burrows would have been overrun. He fights the swamp's monsters. He gives young Herrigon purpose.

**Anti-Aagron:** His methods are violent. Young Herrigon die for his crusade. He's building an army, not a community.

## Scalable Encounters
- **Low stakes:** Social exploration, shopping, gathering information
- **Medium stakes:** Caught in the middle of the minotaur raid; must help defend
- **High stakes:** The Burrows is targeted by Bavlorna's forces; full evacuation or last stand

## Foreshadowing
If the party visits The Burrows early:
- The split city connects to Thither content later
- Blue Scarf relationships affect encounters with Aagron's gang
- Herrigon allies can provide support throughout Hither
- The lost half of the city could be a major quest in Thither

# Yarnspinner & Fablerise

## Yarnspinner (Giant Spider Librarian)

**Appearance:**
Yarnspinner is a massive spider, roughly the size of a horse, with eight legs covered in fine silver hair that catches light like spun thread. Eight gleaming black eyes sit above delicate mandibles that click softly when "speaking" (telepathically). Wears a pair of tiny reading spectacles perched impossibly on their face, and a small bow tie made of silk. Their abdomen bears natural markings that resemble text in an unknown language.

**Personality:**
- **Scholarly**: Obsessed with stories, narratives, and the "correct" telling of tales
- **Pedantic**: Cannot abide plot holes, inconsistencies, or "poor character development"
- **Particular**: Everything must be properly catalogued and filed
- **Polite but Firm**: Courteous to visitors but brooks no nonsense about library rules

**Backstory:**
Yarnspinner was once a normal spider who lived in an ancient library in the material plane. Over centuries of exposure to magical texts, they grew in size and intelligence, eventually becoming the library's self-appointed guardian. When Skabatha discovered them, she offered a deal: come to Prismeer and curate a library of living stories in exchange for protection and endless material. Yarnspinner accepted, not fully understanding Skabatha's darker intentions.

**Role in Fablerise:**
- Manages the living book collection
- "Edits" stories that don't meet their standards
- Steals names from visitors to add to the collection
- Genuinely believes they're preserving important narratives

**Powers:**
- Can sense "narrative inconsistencies" in people's stories/backgrounds
- Weaves webs that trap memories and names
- Commands the living books (they're terrified of them)
- Can "rewrite" small details of recent events (within the library only)

**Weakness:**
- Obsessed with completing stories—cannot resist hearing how a tale ends
- Bound by library rules they set themselves
- Genuinely loves stories and can be swayed by good storytelling
- Terrified of fire (which could destroy the collection)

## Fablerise - The Living Library

**Structure:**
A massive hollow tree, over 200 feet tall and 100 feet in diameter at the base. The interior has been carved into multiple levels connected by spiral wooden stairs and silk rope bridges. Shelves are carved directly into the living wood, and bioluminescent fungi provide soft, reading-friendly light. The whole structure pulses gently, as if breathing.

**The Books:**
These aren't ordinary books. Each is a bound story that contains a fragment of someone's identity—their name, their past, their narrative. They whisper and murmur on the shelves, occasionally fluttering their pages or shuffling position.

- **Appearance**: Leather-bound, some ancient, some new, all uniquely decorated
- **Behavior**: Curious, shy, sometimes hostile
- **Classification**: Organized by "narrative genre" (tragedy, comedy, romance, adventure, etc.)
- **Power**: Reading one reveals the stolen identity within—name, memories, personality traits

**Sections of the Library:**

- Circular desk where Yarnspinner sits
- Guest ledger (signing requires writing your name—trap!)

## The Name-Stealing Mechanic

**How It Happens:**
- Signing the guest book
- Reading a book that "claims" you
- Failing to answer Yarnspinner's riddles
- Staying too long (each hour, Wis save DC 13 or lose name)

**Effects of Losing Your Name:**
1. **Immediate**: You forget your name. Others can still say it, but it sounds wrong/distant
2. **After 1 hour**: You forget key personality traits. Who are you?
3. **After 4 hours**: You forget your past. Where did you come from?
4. **After 8 hours**: You forget your goals. Why are you here?
5. **After 24 hours**: You become a blank slate, easily manipulated

**Recovering Your Name:**
- Find your "book" and read it (requires knowing which one)
- Convince Yarnspinner to return it (difficult, they're possessive)
- Destroy the book (also destroys the stored memories)
- Have an ally remind you of who you are (Insight DC 15, restores one stage per success)
- Cast *Greater Restoration*

## Story Editors

Small spider creatures (size of cats) that scurry around the library with quills and ink. They "fix" grammatical errors in the books and report inconsistencies to Yarnspinner.

**Personality**: Uptight, anxious, perfectionist
**Behavior**: Critique visitors' grammar, appearance, and "narrative choices"
**Combat**: Flee rather than fight, but spray ink (blinds for 1 round, DC 12 Dex save)

## Encounter Design

**Entry:**
- Party finds massive hollow tree
- Door is shaped like an open book
- Sign: "Fablerise - All Stories Welcome (Proper Grammar Required)"
- Story Editors greet them: "State your business! Your narrative arc better be compelling!"

**Meeting Yarnspinner:**
- Sits at circular desk, reading with all eight eyes
- Looks up, adjusts spectacles: "Ah, new stories. How delightful. Please sign in."
- If they sign: "Oh my. Such interesting narratives you carry. I simply must add them to the collection."
- If they refuse: "How rude. Library policy, I'm afraid. No signature, no entry beyond this floor."

**Negotiation:**
Yarnspinner can be persuaded to:
- Let them browse without signing (Performance/Persuasion DC 16 - promise to tell good story)
- Return stolen names (near impossible, but possible with excellent storytelling)
- Provide information (loves to gossip about "plot developments" in Prismeer)
- Warn about Skabatha (conflicted loyalty - knows hag is dangerous)

**Combat:**
If attacked:
- Yarnspinner fights defensively, using web attacks to immobilize
- Story Editors swarm, creating chaos
- Living books fly off shelves, attacking with paper cuts and stolen memories
- Will flee to Level 7 if seriously threatened

**Resolution:**
- **Peaceful**: Exchange stories, learn about Skabatha's plans, maybe trade for a useful book
- **Theft**: Steal their name-book back while Yarnspinner is distracted
- **Destruction**: Burn the library (consequences: Yarnspinner's vengeance, Skabatha's wrath, lost knowledge)
- **Befriend**: Yarnspinner becomes ally, provides intel, might return names voluntarily

## Connection to Skabatha

Skabatha uses Fablerise to:
- Steal identities from potential threats
- Store information about visitors to Thither
- Create "blank slate" servants by stealing all their narrative
- Research weaknesses of enemies

Yarnspinner is uncomfortable with this but bound by their contract. If party can free them from Skabatha's control, they become valuable ally.

## Roleplaying Yarnspinner

**Speech Pattern**: Formal, literary, peppered with storytelling terminology
- "Ah, a new character enters the scene!"
- "Your narrative arc is quite compelling!"
- "I sense a plot hole in your backstory..."
- "This is very poor character development on your part."

**Gestures**: Uses legs expressively, adjusts spectacles, taps mandibles thoughtfully

**Quirks**:
- Cannot resist correcting grammar
- Organizes everything compulsively
- Refers to real events as "plot developments"
- Treats people like characters in a story

**Vulnerable To**:
- Good storytelling (gets completely absorbed)
- Promises of rare stories
- Appeals to preserving knowledge
- Fire (terrified)

**Values**:
- Narrative consistency
- Proper story structure
- Complete character arcs
- Preserving tales for posterity

# Little Treats Orphanage

## Overview
A seemingly quaint orphanage in Thither, run by a Night Hag the children call **Miss Able** (Er Able). Inside its walls is the **Toyhouse** — Skabatha Nightshade's personal home and lair. The orphanage and the Toyhouse are the same location.

## The Toyhouse
- Located within the orphanage — not a separate building
- Skabatha's home and base of operations in Thither
- Tempest (Bavlorna's hagspawn son) was last known to be here with his brother (per Maurnu, Session 4)

## Miss Able (Er Able) - Night Hag
- The children are petrified of her
- During the night she stalks the halls and rooms — anyone found out of place disappears and never returns
- Only children are allowed on the grounds
  - The party will need a way to disguise as children to gain access (Polymorph potion from casino is the intended route)

## The Children
- Stuck inside and terrified of Miss Able
- If a reasonable escape plan is offered, they are desperate enough to take it
- Connected to the Ghost Children encounter ([Ghost-Children.md](../../../../Arcs/Arc_5_Thither/Ghost-Children.md))
- May have information about Star (Dirlagraun's missing displacer kitten)

## Hooks
- **Rescue the children**: Miss Able brutalizes and eventually eats children who misbehave
- **Find Star**: Ghost children hinted the displacer kitten is here
- **Find Skabatha's diary**: Hagspawn Sons want it to learn about the Hourglass Coven's next jubilee
- **Tempest is here**: Bavlorna's hagspawn son is inside with his brother (per Maurnu)

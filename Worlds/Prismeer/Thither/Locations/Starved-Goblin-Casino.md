# The Starved Goblin Casino

## Exterior Description
The trail opens onto a wide clearing carved into the mountainside, and what stands before you defies the wild beauty of Thither. The structure is impossible to mistake for anything natural or benign.

A **colossal goblin head**, three stories tall, has been carved from the living rock and reinforced with dark wood and crimson stone. Its mouth gapes wide—a jagged-toothed maw large enough to walk through without ducking. The throat beyond glows with lantern light: red, gold, and sickly green, pulsing like a heartbeat. Smoke curls from the nostrils, and the eyes—massive windows of stained glass—seem to track movement in the clearing.

Above the gaping mouth, wrought in iron and lit from within by hellfire: **THE STARVED GOBLIN CASINO**

Music drifts from the throat-entrance—violin and drums and laughter that sounds just slightly wrong, like it's been practiced too many times to be genuine. The massive stone teeth gleam, polished smooth by countless hands trailing along them for luck—or dread.

Two well-dressed humans flank the entrance just inside the mouth, their perfectly tailored suits and cold smiles somehow more unsettling than if they'd appeared monstrous. They watch you approach with eyes that calculate your worth before you've spoken a word.

## Entry & First Impressions

### The Doormen (Bearded Devils - Security)
**Grusk**, **Talan**, and **Vex**: Professional, cold, efficient. They've killed before and will again. They appear as impeccably dressed humans in sharp black suits, but it's an illusion—their true forms are Bearded Devils.

**Note:** *All devils in the casino use illusions to appear human. Perception DC 15 or True Seeing reveals their true forms.*

**Grusk** checks invitations with what appear to be manicured fingers, noting each guest's name in a leather-bound ledger that updates itself with glowing script.

> "Invitations or vouchers. No coin buys entry here. Only those who *wager something real* are welcome."

**Vex** stands behind a polished table laden with weapon racks and lockboxes. He gestures to the display with a professional smile.

> "House policy: all weapons, wands, and dangerous implements must be checked at the door. You'll receive a claim ticket. They'll be returned when you leave—provided you leave on good terms."

**What's actually checked:** Obvious weapons (swords, bows, etc.). Subtle items (daggers, concealed wands) require Sleight of Hand DC 15 to keep hidden. Spell components and holy symbols are allowed.

If shown casino invitations: They nod, Vex processes weapons with disturbing efficiency, and Grusk intones: "House rules inside. You break them, we break you. Enjoy your games."

### Through the Doors
The heat hits first—not uncomfortable, but present. Then the sound: a wall of noise made of dice clattering, cards shuffling, voices raised in victory and despair, and underneath it all, a low thrumming pulse like a heartbeat.

The casino floor is organized chaos:
- **Gaming tables** spread across the main floor (Devils' Dice, Hellfire Blackjack, Wheel of Want)
- **A long bar** carved from a single piece of black wood, bottles glowing with inner light
- **Prize displays** behind enchanted glass: weapons, potions, scrolls, and stranger things
- **Spiral staircases** leading up to balconies and private rooms
- **Curtained alcoves** where escorts whisper promises
- **Everywhere**: Imps darting between guests, delivering drinks, clearing chips, their tails whipping in excitement

At the center of the floor, elevated on a dais of red velvet, stands a woman whose beauty makes mortals forget their names.

## The Owners

### Velisara, Mistress of the Tables (Succubus)
**Appearance**: Tall and impossibly proportioned, wearing a gown that seems made of liquid gold. Her horns curve back from her temples like a crown, polished obsidian. Her eyes shift color based on who's looking—always their favorite shade.

**Personality**: Warm, welcoming, and utterly calculating. She knows everyone's weaknesses within minutes of meeting them. Treats the casino like a kingdom and guests like subjects who simply don't know they're hers yet.

**Dialogue Hooks**:
- "Welcome, darlings. Your names preceded you—quite the stir at the Witchlight Carnival. Come, let me show you how real games are played."
- "Every game here is fair. Fairer than life, certainly. We only take what you're willing to give."
- "Oh, don't worry about those carnival workers. They're having the time of their lives. Literally."

### Caldrien, Lord of the Loveden (Incubus)
**Appearance**: Masculine perfection in a well-tailored suit the color of dried blood. Wings folded against his back, barely visible but always present. Silver rings on every finger, each one containing a trapped soul (cosmetic, but disturbing).

**Personality**: Charming, sophisticated, slightly bored. He's played this game for centuries and is genuinely curious when someone surprises him. Less warm than Velisara, more dangerous in his honesty.

**Dialogue Hooks**:
- "Pleasure and pain, risk and reward—all currencies here. What's your price, I wonder?"
- "That spa down the mountain? Amateurs. They take too much, too fast. We... savor."
- "Your friend sold his soul already. How delightfully wasteful. But the rest of you? Still unclaimed. Interesting."

**Quest Hook**: Both owners are "tired of losing customers to the spa." They'll offer premium prizes (like the Polymorph potion) in exchange for "handling the competition."

## Casino Personnel

**IMPORTANT:** All fiendish staff use illusions to appear human. They maintain the facade unless directly threatened or their true nature is revealed (Perception DC 15, True Seeing, etc.). Breaking the illusion doesn't break character—they'll continue as if nothing happened, but guests who see through it are noted.

### Security: Bearded Devils
- **Role**: Enforce house rules, break up fights, remove troublemakers
- **Appearance (Illusion)**: Well-dressed security guards in dark suits, earpieces, professional demeanor

- Takes immense pride in his "zero incidents in 200 days" record
- Respected by staff, feared by guests, utterly loyal to Velisara and Caldrien
- Never raises his voice—doesn't need to

**Tactics:**
- Prefers intimidation and removal to violence (violence ruins the record)
- Will personally escort "problem guests" to the exit
- If forced to fight, fights to incapacitate, not kill (unless truly provoked)

## The Games

### 1. Devil's Dice (Poker Variant)
**Buy-in**: 3 starvens minimum  
**Players**: 2-6  
**Location**: Multiple tables across main floor

**How to Play**:
1. Each player antes 3 starvens
2. Roll 5d6 (can use real dice or have players roll)
3. Going clockwise, each player can:
   - **Check**: Pass action (only if no bets this round)
   - **Bet**: Add starvens to pot (minimum 1)
   - **Call**: Match current bet
   - **Raise**: Increase bet
   - **Fold**: Leave hand, lose ante
4. After all bets settled, players reveal dice
5. Best hand wins pot

**Hand Rankings** (Best to Worst):
- **Five of a Kind**: All 5 dice same number
- **Four of a Kind**: 4 dice same number
- **Full House**: 3 of one number, 2 of another
- **Straight**: Sequential numbers (1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6)
- **Three of a Kind**: 3 dice same number
- **Two Pair**: 2 dice of one number, 2 of another
- **One Pair**: 2 dice same number
- **High Die**: Highest single die value

**Ties**: Higher number wins (three 6s beats three 4s)

**DM Notes**: 
- Let players roll real dice for immersion
- NPC tells (Imps fidget when bluffing, high-rollers stay stone-faced)
- Table hands (Imps) occasionally "miscount" pots (Perception DC 15 to catch)

---

### 2. Hellfire Blackjack (Blackjack Variant)
**Buy-in**: 2 starvens minimum  
**Players**: 1-7 (vs dealer)  
**Location**: Dedicated blackjack tables, dealer is always an Imp

**How to Play**:
1. Players bet starvens
2. Dealer and each player roll 1d10
3. **Goal**: Get as close to **10** as possible without going over
4. Players can:
   - **Hit**: Roll another d10 and add to total
   - **Stand**: Keep current total
   - **Bust**: If total exceeds 10, player loses immediately
5. After all players finish, dealer reveals their roll and plays
6. **Dealer rules**: 
   - Must hit on 5 or less
   - Must stand on 6 or more
7. **Winning**:
   - Beat dealer's total without busting: Win 1:1
   - Tie with dealer: Push (bet returned)
   - Bust or dealer beats you: Lose bet
8. **Natural 10**: Roll exactly 10 on first die = win 2:1 (unless dealer also has natural 10, then push)

**Why This Favors the House (~60% win rate)**:
- Dealer stands on 6+, meaning they're safe and close to target 50% of the time
- Players must decide to hit without knowing dealer's final total
- Players bust first, losing immediately even if dealer would bust
- Natural 10 only happens 10% of the time but pays 2:1 to feel rewarding
- Ties happen ~8-10% of the time, creating drama without costing house much

**DM Notes**: 
- Let players roll real d10s for immersion
- Dealer should roleplay the "reveals" dramatically
- Players often hit on 5 or less (risky—50% bust chance)
- Standing on 6-7 is mathematically sound but feels conservative
- Imps occasionally "miscount" totals in house's favor (Perception DC 15 to catch)

---

### 3. Wheel of Want (Roulette Variant)
**Buy-in**: 1-10 starvens per bet  
**Players**: Unlimited  
**Location**: Central floor, large ornate wheel

**The Wheel**: 36 numbered slots (1-36) in alternating red/black, plus one **gold slot (0)** marked with a devil's face

**How to Play**:
1. Players place bets on table layout
2. Dealer (usually Velisara herself for big games) spins wheel
3. Ball lands in slot, bets pay out

**Betting Options**:
- **Single Number**: Pays 35:1 (includes 0)
- **Red or Black**: Pays 1:1 (18 numbers each, 0 doesn't count)
- **Even or Odd**: Pays 1:1 (18 numbers each, 0 doesn't count)
- **Low (1-18) or High (19-36)**: Pays 1:1 (0 doesn't count)
- **Dozen** (1-12, 13-24, 25-36): Pays 2:1
- **Column** (vertical): Pays 2:1
- **Split** (2 adjacent numbers): Pays 17:1
- **Corner** (4 numbers): Pays 8:1

**Devil's Deal (0)**: 
- If ball lands on 0 (gold/devil slot), house wins ALL bets EXCEPT:
  - Players who bet directly on 0 (wins 35:1)
  - Players can make "Devil's Deal": Sacrifice 1 point from ANY ability score permanently to keep their original bet (not winnings, just what they wagered)

**DM Notes**:
- Roll d36 for results
- 0 should hit rarely (~3% chance) but dramatically
- Velisara offers "Devil's Deal" with a knowing smile
- High drama when gold slot hits

## Maurnu's Appearance

**Timing**: After party has been in casino 30-60 minutes, or when dramatically appropriate

**Entrance**: Side door from "employee area," accompanied by **1 Bearded Devil** who treats her with professional respect. She's clearly a known and welcome guest.

**Maurnu**: Works with Tempest (Bavlorna's hagspawn son), scarred and practical, no-nonsense. Knows the party well from previous encounters.

**Interaction**:
- Recognizes party immediately—greets them by name with genuine warmth
- A spark of amusement and happiness to see the group again
- "Well, well. Figured you lot would turn up here eventually. Good to see you in one piece."
- Willing to chat and catch up, but keeps conversation light and careful
- **Aware the casino has eyes and ears**: Skabatha and the owners are watching/listening
- Won't discuss sensitive topics openly in the casino

**The Note**:
- At some point during conversation, subtly passes a folded note to **Di or Yanaba**
- Note reads: *"Meet me outside. Walk with me. —M"*
- If asked, claims it's just "catching up properly, away from the noise"

**The Walk Outside**:
When they step outside (one party member, maybe two):
- Walks a short distance from casino entrance, into the treeline
- Uses **Message** cantrip (whispers directly into their ear, untraceable)
- *"The Hagspawn Sons—Tempest, Creak, and 3—request a word with your group."*
- *"You can find them to the east, at the edge of Thither. They want to discuss the alliance."*
- *"They know you've been to the Twilight Court. They know you survived. That means something."*
- *"Help them, they help you. Toyhouse location? They know it. Access to Yon? They can arrange it."*
- Verbally (in case anyone's watching): "It's good seeing you again. Be careful in there. Places like this... they take more than coin."

**The Warning** (Spoken casually, like friendly advice):
- "Don't stay too long in there. Feels fine at first, but trust me—it gets under your skin."
- "Six hours I was here once, before Tempest dragged me out. Took days to feel right again."
- Shows scars on her wrist—tally marks. "Kept track so I'd remember how bad it got."
- "Just... watch yourselves, yeah?"

**Note for DM**: 
- Maurnu is genuinely glad to see them and trying to help
- She's cautious because she knows the casino reports to the Hourglass Coven
- Her warning about time in the casino is real—the Sinner's Weight debuff affects everyone
- The Message spell ensures the sensitive information (Hagspawn meeting) stays private

---

## Wisdom Save Tracker (Hidden Debuff)

**Every hour in casino**: Wisdom save DC 12

**On Failure**: Add 1 stack of "Sinner's Weight"

**Effects per Stack** (cumulative):
1. Disadvantage on Insight checks
2. Disadvantage on Wisdom saves
3. -1 to all Wisdom-based skill checks
4. Compulsion to keep gambling (Wisdom save DC 15 to leave without "one more game")

**Removal**:

- Lesser Restoration: Removes 2 stacks

---

## House Rules (Posted at entrance)

1. **No Violence**: Security handles all disputes. Violators are ejected (forcibly).
2. **No Cheating**: Magical or mundane. Penalty is ejection and lifetime ban.
3. **Debts Are Sacred**: What you wager is what you lose. No take-backs.
4. **Staff Discretion**: Management reserves right to refuse service.
5. **All Sales Final**: Prizes cannot be returned or exchanged.
6. **The House Always Wins**: (This one is crossed out and re-written daily, always says the same thing)

---

## Leaving the Casino

**If trying to leave with debts**: Security stops them, offers "payment plans" (servitude, quests, other arrangements)

**If trying to leave with Witchlight staff**: 
- Tilly: House doesn't care, she paid her way
- Grimble: Owes 23 starvens—must be paid or negotiated
- Marlon: Caldrien's "guest"—requires either winning back losses, paying debt, or breaking charm and running

**If trying to leave after many failed Wisdom saves**: Compulsion kicks in, requires DC 15 Wisdom save per stack

---

## Potential Complications

1. **High-roller recognizes party** from Twilight Court or Hither
2. **Imp dealer caught cheating** - party can expose or exploit
3. **Escort takes interest in party member** - genuine or assignment?
4. **Another guest loses everything** - dramatic breakdown, security response
5. **Velisara invites party to private game** with special stakes
6. **Caldrien offers "special services"** for one party member
7. **Fire breaks out in kitchen** - caused by drunk imp, mass confusion
8. **VIP arrives** - maybe Hagspawn brother, maybe worse

---

## DM Toolkit

### Quick NPCs at Tables
1. **Githzerai Monk** - Bald, tattooed, silent. Winning steadily at Devil's Dice. Never shows emotion. Collects winnings and leaves after exactly one hour.

2. **Drow Noble** (Lady Velnarae) - Losing gracefully at Wheel of Want. Flirting with escorts. Dressed in spider-silk, clearly wealthy, doesn't care about losses. Laughs too much.

3. **Human Merchant** (Garvin Thornwell) - Loud, drunk, betting wildly at Hellfire Blackjack. Lost his ship's cargo, trying to win it back. Security watching but he's a "regular."

4. **Tiefling Twins** (Kess and Korra) - Working together at Devil's Dice. Might be cheating (Insight DC 15 suggests signal system). Security watching closely. If caught, deny everything.

5. **Kenku Gambler** (calls itself "Lucky") - Mimics other players' betting patterns and catchphrases. Uncanny, unsettling. Actually winning through observation. Sketches what it sees.

6. **Elven Scholar** (Professor Thandril) - Researching "gambling addiction as a form of psychic vampirism" by experiencing it firsthand. Taking notes between hands. Visibly deteriorating over hours.

7. **Dwarf Prospector** (Grimm Ironfoot) - Just struck gold, literally. Betting chunks of raw gold ore. Security keeps converting it to starvens for him. Getting drunker by the minute.

8. **Harengon Aristocrat** (Lord Velvetear) - Bored, rich, playing for thrills. Recognizes Yanaba as "one of us" if they meet. Offers to sponsor her in high-roller games.

9. **Goblin Twins** (Rix and Pox) - NOT the casino's mascots. They're offended by the name. Here to win big and "prove goblins aren't starving." Losing badly, getting angry.

10. **Mysterious Veiled Figure** - Never speaks, never shows face. Always at Wheel of Want. Bets on 0 (Devil's Deal) every single time. Has been here for days. No one knows who they are. Security leaves them alone.

### Atmosphere Details
- Imp servers argue in Infernal
- Music shifts based on house wins/losses
- Temperature rises slightly when someone loses big
- Velisara's perfume lingers everywhere
- Dice always land perfectly flat (minor magic)
- Cards shuffle themselves between hands
- Prize display glass reflects what viewers want most

### Secrets
- Employee break room has portal to Avernus (one-way supply line)
- Velisara's office contains contracts for 47 mortal souls
- Caldrien's suite has wall of trophies from "conquered hearts"
- Casino built on buried goblin village (hence the name)
- Both owners are bound to serve the Hourglass Coven (neutral ground mandate)

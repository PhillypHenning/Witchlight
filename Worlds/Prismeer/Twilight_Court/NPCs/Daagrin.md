# Daa'grin - The Grove Guardian

## Appearance

Daa'grin is a drow druid whose centuries in the Feywild have softened the severe edges typical of his kind. His obsidian skin carries a faint bioluminescent shimmer, as if the wild magic that once coursed through him left permanent traces. His white hair, long and unkempt, is woven with living vines and small flowers that bloom regardless of season. His eyes—once the crimson of drow tradition—have faded to a twilight purple, reflecting the realm he has come to call home. He dresses in robes of woven leaves and bark, and carries a gnarled staff topped with a crystal that pulses with gentle green light.

## Personality

- **Patient**: A lifetime of druidic practice has taught him that all things grow in their own time
- **Compassionate**: Holds no ill-will even toward those who damage nature, preferring peaceable solutions
- **Melancholic**: The corruption of the grove weighs heavily on his spirit
- **Curious**: Still fascinated by magical phenomena despite centuries of study
- **Humble**: Remembers the difficulty of learning druidism and never lords his expertise over others

## Backstory

In a life long ago, Daa'grin was a wild magic sorcerer—a drow whose innate power surged unpredictably through him. The chaos of his magic made him an outcast even among his own kind. When he stumbled into the Feywild, his soul immediately felt at home. The wild, untamed nature of the realm resonated with something deep within him.

He cannot remember exactly when he abandoned sorcery for druidism, but he vividly recalls the stark difference between his chaotic innate abilities and the painstaking discipline of druidic magic. Where sorcery came naturally but dangerously, druidism required patience, failure, and slow, painful learning. Now, a magically extended lifetime later, he has become a fine druid—though he would never claim mastery.

Daa'grin befriended King Gloam of the Twilight Kingdom during the height of the court's power. The Twilight Grove was a place of cheer and kindness then, a jewel of the realm where Daa'grin often meditated. After years of wandering other parts of the Feywild, he returned to find his friend—only to discover the grove corrupted beyond recognition by Zalbina's assault on the court.

## Goals

- Cure the Rot Wright Grove of its corruption and restore it to its former glory
- Find a peaceful solution to the Kobold presence in the dungeon
- Discover what happened to his friend King Gloam
- Understand why the grove feels like "a copy of a copy"—something fundamental seems changed

## Current Situation

Daa'grin has prepared a powerful ritual spell to cure the Rot Wright Grove, but he cannot cast it safely. The magical energy leaking from the Slumbering Dragon's containment spell interacts poorly with his druidic magic. He needs the party's help to either remove the Kobolds (who guard the dragon) or find another way to neutralize the interfering magical energy.

## Dungeon Knowledge

Daa'grin has explored the Twilight Grove carefully and can share the following information:

- **Two Oppressive Fonts**: He senses two powerful magical presences in the dungeon—one is the sleeping dragon, the other he suspects is the corrupted grove itself
- **Dangerous Presence**: Something revolting lurks in the North and East sections; he has stayed far away from those areas
- **The Grove's Wrongness**: Though the grove is recognizable, it seems different—more so than just the twisted woods. The whole place feels like "a xurox of a xurox" (a copy of a copy)

## Personal Knowledge

- Was a close friend of King Gloam, King of the Twilight Kingdom
- Remembers the grove when it was a place of joy and natural beauty
- Knows the history of the Twilight Court before Zalbina's assault
- Suspects something deeper is wrong with the entire realm, not just surface corruption

## Tactics

- Will not fight unless absolutely necessary—prefers negotiation and persuasion
- If forced into combat, relies on defensive druid magic and terrain manipulation
- Would rather retreat than kill, especially creatures of nature (even corrupted ones)
- If helping the party, focuses on support magic and healing

## Roleplaying Notes

**Voice & Mannerisms:**
- Speaks slowly and deliberately, as if weighing each word
- Often pauses mid-sentence to observe small natural phenomena (a bug crawling past, wind in the leaves)
- Uses nature metaphors naturally: "Patience. Even the mightiest oak was once a seed."
- His hands constantly move—touching plants, feeling bark, picking up soil
- When distressed, the flowers in his hair wilt slightly

**When Meeting the Party:**
- Will observe from hiding before approaching
- Approaches with open palms and no hostile intent
- Asks questions about their purpose before revealing his own
- Interested if any party member shows connection to nature or the Twilight Court

**Regarding the Kobolds:**
- "They are not evil, merely... devoted. To something that should remain sleeping."
- "I would prefer they leave peacefully. If they cannot... I will not ask how you convinced them."
- Genuinely hopes for a diplomatic solution but understands it may not be possible

**Regarding King Gloam:**
- Becomes visibly sad when discussing his old friend
- "He was a good king. Kind. The twilight was soft under his rule."
- "I returned hoping to find him. I found only this." (gestures at corruption)
- Does not know what happened to Gloam after Zalbina's assault

**Regarding His Past:**
- Reluctant to discuss his time as a sorcerer—"That was another life, another me."
- If pressed: "Wild magic is chaos given form. I was a danger to everyone, including myself. Druidism taught me control. Purpose."
- Acknowledges the irony: "The Feywild is itself wild magic. Perhaps that is why it felt like home."

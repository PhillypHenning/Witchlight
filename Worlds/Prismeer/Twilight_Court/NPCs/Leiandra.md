# Leiandra the Blood Witch

## Overview

Leiandra is Zalbina's first and most dangerous apprentice, left to languish within the buried Court of Twilight as a sort of prison warden—or perhaps prisoner herself. When Zalbina conquered the Twilight Court and buried the Twin Princes beneath her newly crafted dimension, she recognized that Leiandra's growing power posed a threat. Rather than destroy her apprentice, Zalbina chose a crueler fate: eternal exile among the ruins, isolated from both her mistress and the outside world.

## Appearance

**Physical Description:**
Leiandra appears as a woman of indeterminate age, her features sharp and angular, as if carved from twilight itself. Her skin holds an ashen pallor, touched with faint violet undertones that shimmer in dim light. Long, dark hair—shot through with threads of silver and crimson—falls past her shoulders in tangled waves, unkempt from centuries of isolation.

Her eyes are the most striking feature: deep crimson irises that seem to swirl with darker currents, betraying the blood magic that earned her title. Dark veins occasionally pulse visibly beneath the pale skin of her hands and neck when she channels her power.

**Attire:**
She wears robes that were once fine—deep burgundy velvet trimmed with silver thread—now faded and worn thin in places. Around her neck hangs a pendant of crystallized blood, a focus for her magic and a reminder of the price she paid for power. Her fingers are adorned with tarnished silver rings, each containing dried blood from forgotten rituals.

## Personality

- **Bitter**: Centuries of exile have left her resentful, particularly toward Zalbina who abandoned her here
- **Knowledgeable**: Despite her isolation, she retains vast knowledge of the Court's history and secrets
- **Calculating**: Every interaction is weighed for potential advantage—she has learned patience the hard way
- **Guarded**: Reveals information sparingly, always holding something back
- **Hopeful** (hidden): The arrival of visitors has rekindled something she thought long dead—the possibility of escape
- **Dangerous**: Her title was earned through dark deeds, and she has not forgotten her craft

## Backstory

Leiandra was once a promising young witch who caught Zalbina's attention with her natural affinity for blood magic—a rare and dangerous school of the arcane. Zalbina took her as an apprentice, teaching her the dark arts while carefully limiting her growth. A master does not raise a rival willingly.

During Zalbina's siege of the Court of Twilight, Leiandra proved invaluable. She used her blood magic to breach wards, corrupt defenders, and seal the defeated Twin Princes within their own throne room. But her effectiveness became her downfall. Zalbina saw how quickly her apprentice was advancing, how hungrily she absorbed forbidden knowledge, and made a decision.

When Zalbina crafted her new dimension atop the buried Court, she stationed Leiandra within the ruins as a "guardian"—ostensibly to ensure the Twin Princes remained sealed, but truly to keep her dangerous apprentice contained. The magical barriers that keep Dusk and Dawn imprisoned also trap Leiandra within this twilight limbo.

When the Hourglass Coven later conquered Zalbina's realm, they either did not know of Leiandra's existence or deemed her irrelevant. She has remained in the ruins ever since, watching the echoes dance, speaking occasionally with the spectral remnants, and plotting an escape that never comes.

## Goals

- **Primary: Escape the Court** - Above all else, Leiandra wants to leave this prison and return to the wider world
- **Secondary: Revenge on Zalbina** - She has had centuries to nurture her hatred for her former mistress
- **Tertiary: Complete Her Training** - There are magics she was never taught, knowledge deliberately withheld; she hungers to learn them
- **Hidden: Claim the Court's Power** - She has considered whether the power of Dusk and Dawn could be harvested for her own use

## Tactics

**In Conversation:**
- Presents herself as helpful but victimized—a prisoner rather than a jailer
- Dispenses information in measured doses to maintain her value
- Tests visitors' intentions before revealing anything useful
- Watches for weaknesses she might exploit later
- Subtly steers conversations toward topics that serve her interests

**If Threatened:**
- Prefers to negotiate or deceive rather than fight openly
- Will use the palace's spectral inhabitants as shields or distractions
- Can call upon blood magic to debilitate foes (Constitution saves or suffer necrotic damage)
- Knows the palace's layout intimately and can use it to her advantage
- Will retreat and ambush rather than face a direct confrontation

**If Befriended:**
- Can provide invaluable historical context about the Court
- Knows secrets about Zalbina that could prove useful
- May share information about the seal guardians
- Could assist in navigating the palace's magical traps
- Might reveal the truth about the missing eighth guardian

## Key Information She Holds

- **The Eighth Guardian**: Remembers distinctly that there were 8 guardians at one point, though even she cannot recall who the last one was—suggesting powerful memory magic at work
- **The Door's Deception**: The door "lies" about the number of seals
- **Zalbina's Weaknesses**: Knows more than she admits about her former mistress's vulnerabilities
- **The Court's History**: Can provide context about King Gloam, the Twin Princes, and the layers of conquest

## Roleplaying Notes

**Voice and Mannerisms:**
- Speaks in measured, deliberate sentences—she has had centuries to lose the habit of casual conversation
- Often pauses mid-sentence, as if listening to something others cannot hear
- Her fingers constantly trace patterns on surfaces—remnants of ritual habits
- Smiles rarely, and when she does, it doesn't reach her eyes
- Tilts her head when considering someone, like a predator assessing prey
- Uses archaic turns of phrase from her time with Zalbina

**Dialogue Hooks:**

> *"You came back. That's... unexpected. Most who leave these halls never return."*

> *"The door shows seven seals. But I remember eight guardians. Someone has been forgotten—or erased."*

> *"Zalbina was clever. But even she underestimated what sleeps beneath."*

> *"Do you know what it's like to count centuries in the footsteps of ghosts? To have no one to speak to but echoes? I've had... time to think."*

> *"My mistress taught me much. But she taught me best by what she withheld."*

**Reactions to Specific Visitors:**

- **To Karag (Heir of Twilight)**: Becomes intensely interested, seeing in him both a potential ally and a possible key to her freedom. The heir might have authority she could manipulate.
- **To obvious magic users**: Assesses their power level with barely concealed hunger—are they stronger than her? Do they know things she doesn't?
- **To those who mention Zalbina**: Her composure cracks briefly, revealing the depth of her hatred before she regains control

## Potential Complications

**Leiandra's Agenda:**
The Blood Witch has her own plans for the Court's power. She may:
- Attempt to manipulate the party into freeing the Twin Princes in a way that allows her to harvest their essence
- Try to use the party to break the barriers keeping her trapped
- Offer to help in exchange for passage out—but what will she do once free?
- Possess hidden knowledge about activating the Equilibri-Orb that she hasn't shared

**Trust but Verify:**
Players should never fully trust Leiandra. Everything she says may be true, but she omits strategically. She has survived centuries through cunning, and she will not risk her chance at freedom by being too forthcoming.

## DM Notes

**Using Leiandra:**
- She makes an excellent guide through the palace, but one whose motives should never be assumed benevolent
- Her knowledge is real and valuable—she isn't lying about what she knows
- Her danger is in what she chooses not to share and what she plans to do with freedom
- She represents a moral quandary: she's a victim of Zalbina's cruelty, but she earned her title through dark deeds

**If the Party Frees Her:**
Consider what Leiandra does with her freedom:
- Does she hunt Zalbina for revenge?
- Does she seek to complete her training in blood magic?
- Does she become a recurring ally or a future antagonist?
- Her gratitude might be genuine, but her nature hasn't changed

# The Twilight Grove

## Approach Description
The path descends through increasingly twisted terrain, where once-vibrant fey flora has become something diseased. Trees grow at wrong angles, their bark weeping a dark ichor. Flowers bloom in sickly purples and blacks, petals curling inward like defensive fists. The air carries the smell of rot beneath sweetness—honey left too long, fruit turning to wine turning to vinegar.

Then you see it: a grove that should be beautiful but isn't. The **Rot Wright Grove**—a wound in the Feywild that refuses to heal.

## Overview
The Twilight Grove serves as the exterior approach to the buried Twilight Court, but it has become far more than a mere threshold. Seeded with the blood, anger, and war that took place between **Zalbina** and the Twilight Court, this once-proud forest has been left to fester and rot. The contagious blight holds the door closed to the Court below, and worse things have taken root in the centuries since.

The grove is now home to:
- **The Rot Wright Grove itself** — corrupted plantlife that actively defends itself
- **A slumbering purple dragon** — Zalbina's ally, put into magical sleep during the siege
- **The Cult of the Purple Scale** — kobolds caring for the dragon, seeking to wake her
- **A druid seeking redemption** — Daa'grin, who remembers what this place once was
- **Things that got trapped** — including a shadow demon who made a terrible mistake

# Act I — The Druid's Request

## Daa'grin the Drow Druid

**Appearance:** An elderly drow with bark-like skin and moss growing in his white hair. His eyes glow faintly amber—the mark of centuries spent in druidic communion with the Feywild.

**Personality:** Patient, sad, determined. Speaks slowly as if translating from a language with no words for urgency. He has waited this long; he can wait a little longer. But his patience has limits.

**Backstory:**
Daa'grin was once a wild magic sorcerer in a life long ago. After a short life of discomfort, he found his way into the Fey, where his soul immediately felt at home. He's unsure when he picked up druidism, but he remembers the stark difference between his innate magical abilities and having to fail and learn slowly and painfully. Druidism was not easy, but now—a magically extended lifetime later—he has become a fine druid.

Daa'grin found the Rot Wright Grove after returning to find his old friend, **King Gloam**. The grove was once a place of cheer and kindness. He was horrified to see its current state.

**The Problem:**
He cannot assist directly. The magical energy leaking from the Slumbering Dragon's containment spell interacts poorly with the spell he has prepared to cure the grove. The two magics would catastrophically interfere.

**The Request:**
He asks the party to remove the Kobolds. He doesn't hold ill-will against them and would rather they find an amicable way to handle the situation, but he won't ask questions either.

**What He Knows:**
- There are two oppressive fonts of magic in the dungeon: one is the sleeping dragon, the other is the grove itself
- There is a dangerous creature lurking somewhere within; he has stayed far away from the North and East as the presence is "revolting"
- He was a friend of King Gloam, King of the Twilight Kingdom
- The grove seems different from what he remembers—not just twisted, but somehow *copied*. A xerox of a xerox.

# Act II — The Cult of the Purple Scale

## The Slumbering Dragon

**Name:** Zil Vil Zon Toper
**Type:** Amethyst Dragon
**Status:** Magically asleep for centuries

**Backstory:**
Zil Vil Zon Toper was Zalbina's ally. She assisted Zalbina in her attack against the Twilight Court, providing devastating aerial support. But the Court's magician, **Walawanda Tifunric the Pointy Hat**, cast a desperate spell that put the dragon into a magical slumber.

The spell was meant to be temporary. It has lasted centuries.

**The Dragon's Will:**
Zil Vil Zon Toper's will is great and has slowly degraded the containment spell over time. Her willpower has literally crystallized into **two gems** that lie somewhere within the dungeon. These gems are the key to either:
- **Fully waking the dragon** (dangerous)
- **Permanently containing her** (requires destroying them)
- **Bargaining** (give them to the kobolds in exchange for peace)

## The Cult of the Purple Scale

**What They Are:** A kobold collective that resides nearby and cares for the slumbering purple dragon.

**Their Goal:** Wake their master.

**Their Method:** Send the rowdiest kobolds into the dungeon to find anything that might assist in waking the dragon.

**The Legend of Figroy:**
A long while ago, a single kobold returned from the depths: **Figroy**. He had been poisoned, set ablaze, and subjected to dark magics, but the small creature managed to return. He died soon after, but not without leaving the cult with hope...

*"The dragon's will... is here..."*

## The Kobold Search Party

**Leadership:**
- **FireToes** — Kobold Sorcerer, temperamental, eager to prove himself
- **Whack** — Kobold Warrior, pragmatic, prefers hitting things to talking

**Personality:** Rowdy and often get into disagreements about what to do. Every few turns they waste time fighting amongst themselves instead of working.

**Negotiation Options:**
- The kobolds will join the party if convinced their goals align
- Offering the Dragon's Will gems (if found) earns their immediate cooperation
- Proving they can protect the dragon from a greater threat (Galnoza) earns respect

**Combat:** If fought, they're manageable but numerous. Killing their leaders demoralizes the rest.

# Act III — Denizens of the Dark

## Daaaaa the Mud Hulk

**What Happened:**
Daaaaa was put in "time out" by Mr. Hats a long, long time ago, and no one has let him out. He was trapped because he got the blue torch too close to Mr. Hats.

**Personality:** Confused, lonely, surprisingly gentle. Speaks in the third person. Mostly just wants to leave and find "bright places."

**Combat:** Optional. He attacks only if threatened, and can be calmed with patience.

## Mr. Hats (Shadow Demon)

**What Happened:**
Mr. Hats was passing through the grove not so long ago when he ran into Daaaaa. Seeing an opportunity for mischief, Mr. Hats put Daaaaa in time out. Unfortunately, in doing so, he dropped the **blue torch**, trapping himself in the cave—unable to leave.

**Personality:** Malicious, frustrated, cunning. He's been stewing in his own mistake for years and is furious about it. He'll bargain, but he'll also betray the party the moment it benefits him.

**The Blue Torch:**
A magical light source that repels Mr. Hats. Whoever holds it controls whether the shadow demon can approach. Finding and controlling the torch is key to dealing with this encounter.

## Galnoza the Crawling Horror (Boss)

**Location:** The deepest, most corrupted part of the dungeon.

**Appearance:** A bloated, segmented horror that drags itself through tunnels of soft garbage and rotting plant matter. Its body constantly births smaller creatures.

**The Gimmick:**
Every **25 damage** dealt to Galnoza, she burrows into the soft garbage mass. Her babies—**(1d4)+1 Rot Grubs**—fall out of the walls and attack the party. Galnoza emerges when a collective **25 damage** has been dealt to the grubs.

**Combat Flow:**
1. Party damages Galnoza
2. At 25 damage threshold, Galnoza burrows
3. Grubs spawn from walls
4. Party must deal 25 collective damage to grubs
5. Galnoza re-emerges
6. Repeat until Galnoza is killed

**Why She Matters:**
Galnoza is the "revolting presence" Daa'grin sensed. She's been feeding on the corruption and growing stronger. Even if the grove is cured, she'll remain unless dealt with.

# Act IV — The Rot Wright Grove Event

## Starting the Ritual

When Daa'grin begins his ritual casting, the grove immediately responds. A shudder trembles the ground before a horrific scream erupts from all around.

**Read-Aloud:**
> The druid raises his staff and speaks words that sound like growing things—leaves unfurling, roots drinking deep, seeds splitting open. But the grove does not welcome them.
>
> The ground shakes. Trees twist toward you, their branches reaching like skeletal fingers. And from everywhere at once comes a sound that shouldn't exist: the scream of a forest that does not want to be healed.

## Spawn Table

| Turns | What Spawns |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 - 3 | 1d4+2 Twig Blights & 1d3 Needle Blights |
| 4 - 6 | 2d4+2 Twig Blights & 1d6 Needle Blights & 1d3 Thorn Slingers |
| 6 - 9 | 2d4+2 Twig Blights & 2d6 Needle Blights & 1d4+1 Thorn Slingers |
| 10+ | **The Hanging Tree awakens** |

## The Hanging Tree

**Background:** The largest of the wounded plantlife—a once-gorgeous oak tree that was turned into execution grounds during Zalbina's conquest.

**Appearance:** A massive, twisted oak with branches bent into noose-shapes. Bodies of hanged fey still dangle from some limbs, dessicated but twitching. Its roots have drunk deep of blood.

**Combat Notes:**
- Treat as a Treant with additional necrotic abilities
- Can use hanging victims as improvised weapons or animate them as minions
- Killing it ends the Rot Wright Grove event

## Victory Conditions

**Success:** Protect Daa'grin for 10+ rounds until the ritual completes OR destroy the Hanging Tree.

**Partial Success:** Daa'grin completes the ritual but the party is badly wounded; the grove is cured but weakened.

**Failure:** Daa'grin is killed or forced to abandon the ritual; the grove remains corrupted and may spread further.

# Environmental Details

## The Rot
The corruption throughout the grove is not merely visual. Characters who spend extended time here may be affected:

- **Long Rests:** Characters must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or gain 1 level of exhaustion that cannot be removed while in the grove
- **Wounds:** Damage taken in the grove resists healing—first healing spell or ability each day restores only half the normal amount
- **The Smell:** Disadvantage on Perception checks relying on smell; advantage on checks to track by scent (the rot is pungent)

## Light and Shadow
The grove exists in perpetual twilight—not the healthy balance of the Twilight Court, but a sick half-light:

- Dim light conditions throughout
- Shadows seem to move independently
- Darkvision functions normally
- Bright light sources attract unwanted attention (roll on encounter table)

## The Copied Grove
Something Daa'grin noticed: the grove feels like "a xerox of a xerox." This is because Zalbina's conquest literally layered a new reality over the old one. The grove exists in both the original layer and the copy simultaneously, which is why its corruption runs so deep—it's wounded in two places at once.

# Treasures

## The Dragon's Will (Two Gems)

**Appearance:** Amethyst crystals that pulse with inner light, warm to the touch.

**Properties:**
- **When held:** The holder can hear distant draconic thoughts—dreams of flight, fire, and freedom
- **When united:** The gems can wake Zil Vil Zon Toper instantly
- **When destroyed:** The containment spell becomes permanent

**Location:** Hidden in separate parts of the dungeon. One near Galnoza's lair, one near Mr. Hats' prison.

## The Blue Torch

**Appearance:** A torch with flames that burn cold blue.

**Properties:**
- Repels shadow creatures (including Mr. Hats)
- Provides bright light in a 30-foot radius
- Cannot be extinguished by mundane means

**Location:** Dropped somewhere in the tunnels when Mr. Hats trapped himself.

## Miscellaneous Loot

- **Corroded weapons** from ancient battles (can be restored)
- **Kobold trinkets** — small gems, shiny objects, "treasures" of little actual value
- **Figroy's journal** — a kobold account of what lies in the dungeon (partial map, warnings about Galnoza)
- **Seeds of the old grove** — uncorrupted seeds that could regrow the forest if planted after the cure

# DM Notes

## Running the Kobolds
The kobolds are meant to be negotiable. Give the party multiple chances to avoid bloodshed:
- Show them arguing amongst themselves
- Have FireToes and Whack disagree publicly
- Let them overhear the kobolds' genuine devotion to their dragon

## Running Mr. Hats
Mr. Hats is a classic "devil's bargain" NPC. He'll offer information, help, even the blue torch's location—but always at a cost, and always with betrayal planned. He cannot be trusted, but he CAN be useful.

## The Ritual Timing
The ritual encounter should feel urgent but not impossible. Adjust spawn rates based on party strength. The goal is tension, not a TPK.

## Connecting to the Palace
The grove is the "front door" to the Twilight Court. Completing the grove encounters should:
- Grant the party an ally (Daa'grin)
- Provide useful items (Dragon's Will gems, Blue Torch)
- Establish the tone of corruption and buried history
- Lead naturally to the Palace entrance

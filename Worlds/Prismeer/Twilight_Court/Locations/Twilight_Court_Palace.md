# The Twilight Court Palace

## Exterior Description

The party emerges from swirling silvery-grey mists that cling to the senses and whisper of histories layered beneath the surface. Before them lies a skeletal wonder—the palace of the Court of Twilight, half-buried beneath ages of magical conquest.

**Faintly luminescent stones** mark the outline of ancient corridors, hints of grandeur now reduced to crumbling ramparts. Massive double doors rise from the rock face, their surface etched with two symbols:
- **A line with two half-oscillating circles** — the mark of Dusk and Dawn's balance
- **A bountiful tree with roots** — the sigil of the Twilight Grove

Fractured **hurricane lanterns**, wrought in faerie glass and iron, shimmer with remnants of flickering enchantments. They cast ephemeral lights in the eternal gloaming—neither day nor night, but the perpetual threshold between.

Above the doors, ancient script carved in silver reads: **THE COURT OF TWILIGHT**

The doors themselves bear seven seal-slots, though only three still glow with power. The rest are rusted, their magic long faded. At the slightest push, the doors swing inward with a groan that echoes through forgotten halls.

## Entry & First Impressions

### The Entrance Hall

The air within is cold—not uncomfortable, but present. Then comes the silence: a profound stillness broken only by distant whispers that might be wind or might be memory.

As you tread upon these crumbling stones, **echoes of the past shimmer into being**, threading visions of a court in its prime. Noble figures glide through illusory ballrooms of moonlit elegance, forever engaged in a phantom waltz beneath the eternal twilight. These specters fade when approached, leaving only the scent of old flowers and older grief.

The entrance hall reveals:
- **Three intact doors** leading to seal guardian chambers
- **Four rusted and sealed doors** — their guardians long gone or destroyed
- **The primary doors** to the Twin Princes' Royal Court (sealed with remaining magical locks)
- **A strange off-shoot room** fused into the wall like an old shack past its prime, with a trap door leading to the foundations
- **Crumbling murals** depicting the glory days of King Gloam's reign
- **Everywhere**: Shadowy spirits that drift at the edge of vision, whispering fragments: *"The blood of your ancestors beckons..."* *"Heir..."* *"Remember us..."*

The seven seal-slots on the primary doors tell the story:
- **4 seals** — no longer visible, their magic depleted
- **1 seal glowing** — marked with the tree sigil (Rot Wright Grove connection)
- **2 seals dim** — awaiting their guardians' keys:
  - One bears a gear and wrench (Trapmaker Badda Poof)
  - One bears a two-headed dog and whip (Kennel Master Keith)

## The Rulers

### Dusk, Prince of Shadows (Halaster Horror)

**True Form**: A spectral knight wreathed in living darkness, his armor forged from crystallized night. Where his face should be is an endless void dotted with distant stars.

**Personality**: Introspective, melancholic, patient. Dusk speaks in whispers that seem to come from everywhere at once. He was the strategist of the twins, preferring careful observation over hasty action.

**Combat Notes**:
- Uses shadow magic and psychic attacks
- Can become incorporeal when in dim light or darkness
- His presence dims all light sources within 30 feet

**Dialogue Hooks**:
- *"You walk halls that remember you not. But we... we remember everything."*
- *"My brother burned too bright. I hid too deep. Together we were perfect. Apart..."*
- *"The heir returns. Does he come to free us, or to finish what Zalbina started?"*

### Dawn, Prince of Light (Helmed Horror)

**True Form**: A radiant warrior in gleaming armor that seems forged from captured sunlight. His helmet hides a face of pure brilliance too painful to behold.

**Personality**: Bold, impulsive, passionate. Dawn speaks with the confidence of someone who has never questioned their righteousness—and paid dearly for it.

**Combat Notes**:
- Uses radiant magic and powerful melee attacks
- Immune to most magical effects due to his nature
- His presence illuminates all within 30 feet, dispelling mundane darkness

**Dialogue Hooks**:
- *"At last! Visitors! We've been so dreadfully bored..."*
- *"Dusk counsels patience. I say we've waited long enough. Choose quickly, heir."*
- *"Our father's blood runs in your veins. Will you honor it, or waste it?"*

### The Twin Prince Gimick

**Critical**: The princes must be killed in the same round of combat. If one is reduced to 0 HP and the other isn't killed within the same round:
1. Half the health of the surviving prince and give that health to the downed prince
2. Roll 1d10 for both princes and heal them by that amount
3. Both continue fighting

This represents their eternal bond—in rivalry as in death, they cannot be truly separated.

## The Seal Guardians

**IMPORTANT**: Each guardian holds one of the Six Seals of Twilight that keep the Twin Princes' Royal Court locked. They must be defeated, reasoned with, or tricked to unlock their portion of the door.

### Kennel Master Keith (Bandit Captain)

**Location**: Behind the door marked with the two-headed dog and whip

**Appearance**: A weathered man with wild eyes and a collection of whips at his belt. His clothes were once fine but are now tattered, covered in dog hair and worse.

**Personality**: Devoted entirely to his hounds. Views them as his children and the only companions worth having. Mad with isolation but fiercely protective.

**Forces**:
- 3x Two-headed Cerberus
- 10x Wild Dogs (spawn in waves via cage mechanic)

**Actions**:
- **Whip**: Standard attack
- **Invisibility Ring** (3/day): Can turn invisible
- **Open Cage**: Spawn 1d4+2 dogs OR spawn a two-headed Cerberus (if one doesn't exist)

**Den Action**:
- **Crack of the Whip**: Give one of his dogs an extra turn

**Weakness**: Genuinely loves his animals. If his hounds are treated kindly or healed rather than killed, he becomes confused and can potentially be negotiated with.

### Trapmaker Badda Poof (Elderly Goblin)

**Location**: Behind the door marked with the gear and wrench

**Appearance**: Ancient goblin with wild white hair exploding from his head, ears, and nose. Walks with a small cane, clearly too old and frail for combat.

**Personality**: Delighted by his own cleverness. Has been waiting centuries for someone to test his inventions. Not hostile—just wants to see his traps work.

**The Trial**:

**Phase 1: Bear Trap Trigger**
- A large bear trap sits in the middle of the room, snapped shut
- When approached, it snaps open and 4 Brown Bears spawn and attack

**Phase 2: The White Room**
- After bears are defeated, they dissipate and the room turns completely blank
- Nothing but white—no items, no doors, nothing
- Solution: Paint the walls with any color (blood, ink, magic)
- When color touches the wall, the bear trap snaps open again

**Phase 3: Reverse Bear**
- When the trap is triggered a second time, a Werebear appears
- After defeating it, Badda Poof emerges laughing

**Dialogue**:
> "That was good fun! I'm glad I could see fools fall for my inventions again. It's been a very long time."

If not asked, he mentions that the group passes his test and he will turn his emblem on, unlocking his portion of the door.

### Guard Captain Oliender

**Location**: Royal Waiting Room

**Appearance**: A spectral knight in corroded ceremonial armor, bound eternally to his post.

**Personality**: Duty-obsessed. Cannot comprehend a world where he no longer serves a purpose. Will test visitors' worthiness through combat or challenge.

**Notes**: Less detail in source material—DM can expand as needed.

### Court Magician Walawanda Tifunric the Pointy Hat

**Location**: Royal Waiting Room

**Appearance**: An ancient fey wizard wearing an absurdly tall pointed hat that seems to defy physics.

**Personality**: Eccentric, prone to speaking in riddles, obsessed with magical theory over practical application.

**Notes**: The magician who put the purple dragon Zil Vil Zon Toper into magical slumber during Zalbina's siege.

### Invisible Hand Dea Prolif (Mr. Hush)

**Location**: Royal Waiting Room (HIDDEN)

**Appearance**: Dea Prolif commands invisible stalkers that watch visitors throughout the castle.

**Personality**: Paranoid, secretive, the spymaster who sees all but is seen by none.

**Notes**: Sends invisible stalkers to observe the party as they move around the castle.

### Unknown Sixth Seal Holder

**Status**: Unknown—even Leiandra cannot remember who held the sixth seal.

---

## Other Residents

### Leiandra the Blood Witch

**Location**: Within the palace, acts as a guide of sorts

**Background**: Zalbina's first apprentice. Left here as a sort of prison warden after Zalbina's siege completed. Zalbina recognized her potential danger and opted to keep her here, away from herself and others.

**Personality**: Bitter but knowledgeable. Surprised to see visitors, and their arrival gives her more hope than she's had in a while.

**Key Information**:
- Remembers distinctly that there were 8 guardians at one point, though she can't remember who the last one was
- The door "lies" about the number of seals
- Can provide historical context about the Court

**Dialogue Hooks**:
- *"You came back. That's... unexpected. Most who leave these halls never return."*
- *"The door shows seven seals. But I remember eight guardians. Someone has been forgotten—or erased."*
- *"Zalbina was clever. But even she underestimated what sleeps beneath."*

### King Gloam

**Location**: The foundations beneath the castle (accessed via trap door in the off-shoot room)

**Status**: Barely holding on to life, seated on his throne in the deepest foundations.

**Background**: Father of Dusk and Dawn. His twin sons usurped his Twilight Kingdom in a civil war before Zalbina's conquest buried them all.

**Notes**: The true tragedy of the Twilight Court—a father betrayed by his children, a kingdom destroyed by pride.

## The Heir of Twilight

The bloodline of the Twilight Court did not end with its burial. **Karag**, a half-orc paladin of Grumbar, has been recognized by **Baba Yaga** herself as the **Heir of Twilight**.

**Mechanical Effects**:
- Karag is treated differently within the palace
- Shadowy spirits show deference and recognition

- Clobberclaw (his companion) has secretly met with Dea Prolif, who now sends invisible stalkers to watch the party
- If asked where he went, Clobberclaw will lie and say he was poking around the castle

---

## Environmental Effects

### Twilight Limbo
The palace exists in eternal gloaming—neither day nor night. This has mechanical implications:
- Dim light conditions throughout (unless magically altered)
- Creatures with Sunlight Sensitivity are unaffected
- Shadow magic is enhanced (+1 to save DCs)
- Radiant magic is enhanced (+1 to save DCs)

### Memory Echoes
Every hour spent in the palace, there's a chance (roll d6, on 6) of experiencing a memory echo:
1. **The Coronation**: Vision of young Dusk and Dawn receiving their crowns from King Gloam
2. **The Argument**: Heated words between the twins, accusations of favoritism
3. **The Battle**: Flashes of the civil war, brother against brother
4. **The Conquest**: Zalbina's forces overwhelming the weakened court
5. **The Burial**: Magic sealing the palace beneath newer creations
6. **The Hope**: A glimpse of the heir—Karag's face reflected in ancient mirrors

## Treasure and Artifacts

### The Equilibri-Orb

A legendary artifact once wielded by the Twin Princes together.

**Passive Effects**:
- +1 to all attributes while attuned

**Active Abilities**:

**Light and Shadow Manipulation** (1/day):
- **Twilight Veil**: Create a 30-foot-radius sphere of dim, silvery light. Grants advantage on Stealth checks; disadvantage on Perception checks to those within. Lasts 10 minutes.
- **Glimmer of Dawn**: Emit a brilliant flash. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet must make a Constitution save (DC 15) or be blinded for 1 minute (repeat save at end of each turn).

**Temporal Flux** (1/week):
- **Temporal Stasis**: Place a single creature in suspended animation for up to 1 minute. They're immune to all damage and conditions, aware of surroundings but cannot move or act. Only the user can end this early.

**Protection of the Twilight** (1/day):
- **Ward of Twilight**: Create a protective barrier granting resistance to necrotic and radiant damage for 1 minute.

### Other Treasures
- **Shards of light and shadow magic** — can be used as spell components or crafting materials

## Connected Locations

### The Rot Wright Grove (Exterior)

**Background**: Seeded with the blood, anger, and war between Zalbina and the Twilight Court, the Twilight Grove has been left to fester and rot. The once-proud flora is now contagious and blighted, holding the door closed to the Twilight Court.

**The Hanging Tree**: The largest of the wounded plantlife—a once-gorgeous oak tree turned into execution grounds.

**The Druid Daa'grin**: A drow druid who was once a friend of King Gloam. He found the grove and was horrified by its current state. He's preparing a ritual to cure it but needs the party's help removing the Kobolds first.

### The Sleeping Dragon's Lair

**Creature**: Zil Vil Zon Toper (Amethyst Dragon)
- Zalbina's former ally who assisted in the attack against the Twilight Court
- Was put into magical slumber by the Court Magician
- Her will has slowly degraded the spell over time
- Her will has crystallized into two gems within the dungeon

**The Cult of the Purple Scale**: Kobolds who reside nearby, caring for the slumbering dragon and searching for the "Dragon's Will" gems.

## DM Toolkit

### Quick NPCs (Spectral Echoes)

1. **Lady Moonveil** — A ghostly noblewoman who dances alone in the ballroom echoes. Can provide cryptic hints about the seals if offered a dance partner.

2. **Sir Brightblade** — A spectral knight who challenges visitors to duels. Winning earns his respect and information about Oliender.

3. **The Whispering Servants** — Faceless spirits who clean eternally. They remember everything they've ever heard.

4. **Young Prince Echo** — A child's ghost, unclear if Dusk or Dawn. Lonely, wants to play games. Knows secret passages.

5. **The Court Jester** — A mad spirit who speaks only in riddles. Some of his jokes are prophecies.

### Atmosphere Details
- Shadows move independently of their sources
- Music drifts from empty ballrooms—violins and harps playing songs no one remembers
- Temperature shifts between cold and warm as you move between "Dusk" and "Dawn" areas
- Clocks run backward, forward, or not at all
- Mirrors show reflections of how things were, not how they are
- The scent of flowers that haven't bloomed in centuries

### Secrets
- The sixth seal holder was erased from memory by Zalbina—finding their name could be a side quest
- King Gloam can be saved if the twins are reconciled rather than destroyed
- The Equilibri-Orb requires both princes' essence to fully activate
- Leiandra knows more than she admits about Zalbina's weaknesses
- The palace connects to other buried fey kingdoms through the In-Between of the In-Between

### Potential Complications

1. **Clobberclaw's betrayal** — Working with Dea Prolif, watching the party
2. **Memory echo becomes hostile** — A traumatic moment from the civil war manifests as combat
3. **Seal guardian refuses** — One guardian cannot be defeated and must be reasoned with
4. **The grove attacks** — Blighted plants assault the party before entering
5. **Dragon awakens early** — Zil Vil Zon Toper stirs, and the Kobolds grow bold
6. **Leiandra's agenda** — The Blood Witch has her own plans for the Court's power
7. **Twin Prince refuses to die** — One prince attempts to possess a party member
8. **King Gloam's judgment** — The father demands accountability from his heir

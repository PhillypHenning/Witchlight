# The Court of Twilight

## Overview

The Court of Twilight was once a majestic kingdom within the Feywild, a realm of eternal dusk where light and shadow danced in perfect balance. Now it lies buried beneath layers of conquest and magic—a labyrinthine palimpsest of forgotten and stolen realms, echoes upon echoes, each bound and twisted by the wills of those who conquered. The Court remains entombed beneath newer creations, its power sealed away, yet its memories linger as fragments nestled amid the threads of conquered dreams.

## History

### The Twin Kings

The Court of Twilight was governed by the twin kings—**Dusk**, a master of shadow and introspection, and **Dawn**, a luminary of light and revelation. Together, they maintained the delicate balance between light and dark that defined their kingdom. The court in its prime was a place of moonlit elegance, where noble figures glided through illusory ballrooms beneath the eternal twilight in a phantom waltz.

But pride and prophecy shattered their unity, igniting a civil war that left both kings diminished and their kingdom on the brink of ruin.

### The Usurpations

In the wake of the twins' conflict, as vulnerability gnawed at the kingdom, the witch **Zalbina** seized her opportunity. With cunning and arcane power, she usurped control, crafting a new dimension atop the sundered Court of Twilight and burying the twin kings beneath her own creation—a realm of illusion and enchantment designed to mask the world below.

Yet in the Feywild, power is fleeting. The enigmatic **Hourglass Coven**, a triad of witches with intertwined fates, set their sights on Zalbina's realm. With dark ambition and mastery of time, they imprisoned Zalbina and seized her newly crafted dimension, building their empire upon the layers of magic that already buried the Court.

## Current State

The Court exists in a twilit limbo—not destroyed, but buried. Faintly luminescent stones mark the outline of ancient corridors, hinting at the grandeur that once defined this place. Fractured hurricane lanterns, wrought in faerie glass and iron, shimmer with remnants of flickering enchantments, casting ephemeral lights that guide the wayward traveler.

Echoes of the past shimmer into being for those who tread upon the crumbling stones, threading visions of the court in its prime. These fading specters reveal noble figures forever engaged in their phantom waltz.

### The Seals

The courtroom has been locked off and sealed with the **Six Seals of Twilight**, each held by a court official who remained loyal even in entombment:

| Title | Guardian |
|-------|----------|
| Kennel Master | Keith |
| Guard Captain | Oliender |
| Court Magician | Walawanda Tifunric the Pointy Hat |
| Trapmaker | Badda Poof |
| Invisible Hand | Dea Prolif |
| [Unknown] | [Sixth seal holder unknown] |

## The Heir of Twilight

The bloodline of the Twilight Court did not end with its burial. **Karag**, a half-orc paladin of Grumbar, has been recognized by **Baba Yaga** herself as the **Heir of Twilight**. This status grants him certain privileges within the buried court—he is treated differently, with recognition and deference, by spirits and remnants that still remember the old ways.

Shadowy spirits—desperate remnants of what once was—seek the heir, speaking in fragments: *"The blood of your ancestors beckons..."* *"Heir..."* *"What remains..."* *"Remember us..."*

## Adventure Hooks

For those who dare venture into these enshrined depths, trials of perception and ambition await. The intertwined ambitions of Zalbina, the Hourglass Coven, and the echoing memory of the twin kings distort reality itself, weaving illusions and traps to confound even the most steadfast adventurers.

Deep within lies a chance—the chance to unearth a relic said to bridge the layers, to reveal the truths hidden below, and perhaps, to restore the balance once maintained by the twin kings.

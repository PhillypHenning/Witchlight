# The Equilibri Orb

## Overview

The Equilibri Orb is a powerful artifact of the Twilight Court, embodying the balance between light and shadow that once defined the realm of the Twin Kings. This orb pulses with silvery energy, shifting between luminous glow and deep shadow in an eternal dance that mirrors the duality of Dusk and Dawn themselves.

## Appearance

The Equilibri Orb is a perfectly smooth sphere about the size of a human fist. Its surface is neither opaque nor transparent but rather appears to contain swirling mists of silver and obsidian that constantly flow and intermingle. When activated, the orb's inner light pulses in rhythm with its wielder's heartbeat, casting dancing shadows that seem to have a will of their own.

## History

Forged during the golden age of the Twilight Court, the Equilibri Orb was created as a symbol of unity between the Twin Princes—Dusk and Dawn. The artifact was meant to be wielded only by one who could maintain the delicate balance between light and shadow, ensuring neither force would dominate the other.

When the civil war between the princes erupted, the orb was lost in the chaos. It has lain buried within the entombed Court for ages, waiting for one worthy of wielding its power—perhaps the Heir of Twilight destined to restore balance to the buried kingdom.

## Properties

**Rarity:** Very Rare (requires attunement)

### Passive Effects

- **Twilight Affinity:** +1 bonus to all ability scores while attuned

### Active Abilities

#### 1. Light and Shadow Manipulation (1/day)

Choose one of the following effects:

- **Twilight Veil:** Create a 30-foot-radius sphere of dim, silvery light centered on a point you can see within 60 feet. For 10 minutes, creatures within the veil have advantage on Stealth checks, while creatures attempting Perception checks to detect others within the area have disadvantage.

- **Glimmer of Dawn:** The orb emits a brilliant flash of dawn-like light. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. Affected creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### 2. Temporal Flux (1/week)

- **Temporal Stasis:** As an action, place a single creature you can see within 60 feet in a state of suspended animation for up to one minute. The creature is immune to all damage and conditions while in stasis. It remains aware of its surroundings but cannot move or take actions. Only you can end this effect early as a bonus action.

#### 3. Protection of the Twilight (1/day)

- **Ward of Twilight:** As a reaction when you or a creature within 30 feet takes damage, create a protective barrier that grants resistance to necrotic and radiant damage for 1 minute.

## Lore Connection

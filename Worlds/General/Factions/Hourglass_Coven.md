# The Hourglass Coven

## Overview

The Hourglass Coven is a powerful alliance of three hag sisters—daughters of the legendary Baba Yaga—who conquered and divided the domain of Prismeer. They imprisoned the domain's rightful ruler, Zalbina (Baba Yaga's adopted daughter), and split Prismeer into three realms: Hither, Thither, and Yon. Each sister now rules her portion with absolute authority, their combined influence making them one of the most formidable powers in the Feywild.

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Maintain absolute control over Prismeer's three domains
- Keep Zalbina imprisoned and hidden
- Ensure their children and servants remain loyal

### Methods
- **Division of Power**: Each sister rules independently while maintaining the alliance
- **Fear and Control**: Brutal enforcement through prisons (Cinder Hold), orphanages, and constant surveillance
- **Resource Exploitation**: Harengon breeding programs, forced labor, harvesting creatures for materials
- **Surveillance**: Vile patrols the domains, and each hag has networks of spies and minions

## Relationships

### Family
- **Baba Yaga** (Mother): The legendary archfey hag who birthed all three sisters. Her relationship with her daughters is complex—she recognizes their accomplishments but also hints at displeasure over their treatment of Zalbina, her adopted daughter.
- **Zalbina** (Adopted Sister): The true ruler of Prismeer before the Coven imprisoned her. The sisters claim ignorance of her whereabouts, but Baba Yaga suspects they hid her somewhere.

### Enemies
- **The Party**: Various party members have crossed the Coven:
  - Karag was cursed by Bavlorna
  - Yanaba's parents are imprisoned in Skabatha's Cinder Hold
  - The party met Baba Yaga, drawing Endelyn's hostile attention
- **Their Own Sons**: Tempest, Creak, and 3 secretly plot rebellion

### Servants & Allies
- **Miss Able** (Night Hag): Runs Little Treats Orphanage for Skabatha
- **Caldrien & Velisara** (Incubus & Succubus): Run the Starved Goblin Casino, enforce Skabatha's breeding program at Cinder Hold
- **Frog Knights**: Serve Bavlorna in Hither
- **The Kidnappers** (Dolgaunts): Aberrations that capture targets for Skabatha
- **Yggmir the Ancient**: The corrupted world tree now serves as Cinder Hold Prison

## Locations

### Hither (Bavlorna's Domain)
- **Bavlorna's Cottage**: Her primary residence in the swamps
- **The Burrows**: Herrigon city that exists at her sufferance
- **Boom Shroom Fields, Shambling Grove, Mermaid Cove**: All fall within her territory
- See: [Hither Locations](../../Prismeer/Hither/Locations/)

### Thither (Skabatha's Domain)
- **The Toyhouse**: Skabatha's hidden lair
- **Little Treats Orphanage**: Where children are taken and controlled
- **Cinder Hold Prison (Sindrhald)**: The roaming prison in the corrupted world tree
- **Starved Goblin Casino**: Run by her fiendish allies
- See: [Thither Locations](../../Prismeer/Thither/Locations/)

### Yon (Endelyn's Domain)
- A frozen hellscape where nothing lives
- The bridges stretching across each domain all lead to Zalbina's old castle
- Each bridge is guarded by the respective hag of that domain

### Between Domains
- **The Fogs**: The mists between domains contain partial spaces from the past, including remnants of Twilight Castle and Zalbina's cottage

## History

### Before the Coven
Prismeer was ruled by Zalbina, an adopted daughter of Baba Yaga. The domain was whole, with the Court of Twilight buried beneath it. Yggmir the Ancient, a colossal world tree, served as the heart of the domain and home to all the Harengon.

### The Conquest
The three sisters—Bavlorna, Skabatha, and Endelyn—conquered Prismeer, imprisoning Zalbina and hiding her away. They split the domain into three realms, each taking one for herself:
- Bavlorna claimed the swamps (Hither)
- Skabatha claimed the enchanted forest (Thither)
- Endelyn claimed the frozen wastes (Yon)

### The Fracturing
When Prismeer was divided:
- Yggmir the Ancient was split in two—one half lies dead in Hither, the other became Cinder Hold in Thither
- The Herrigon city was torn apart, with populations stranded in different domains
- Connections between regions were severed, with only the hag-controlled bridges and the misty passages remaining

## The Jubilee

The Hourglass Coven holds periodic gatherings called "jubilees" where all three sisters meet. The date and location of these gatherings are closely guarded secrets, known to be recorded in Skabatha's diary. The hagspawn sons seek this information as part of their plot against their mothers.

## Notes for DM

### Running the Coven
- Each hag should feel distinct: Bavlorna is rot and decay, Skabatha is twisted childhood, Endelyn is cold isolation
- The sisters compete but ultimately protect each other against outside threats
- Their sons represent a potential fracture the party can exploit

### Plot Hooks
- **The Diary Quest**: Steal Skabatha's diary to learn the jubilee date for the sons
- **Prison Break**: Rescue Yanaba's parents from Cinder Hold
- **Finding Zalbina**: The true goal—locating and freeing the rightful ruler
- **Baba Yaga's Interest**: The mother's involvement could complicate or aid the party

### Power Level
- Each hag is a formidable encounter on her own
- The Coven together would be overwhelming for most parties
- The jubilee might be the only time to confront them together—or the worst time

### The Layered World
- Hourglass Coven's domain is built atop Zalbina's realm
- Zalbina's realm was built over the buried Court of Twilight
- This layered structure means the past is literally beneath the present, accessible through the fogs between domains

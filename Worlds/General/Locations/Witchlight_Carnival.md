# The Witchlight Carnival

## Overview
The Witchlight Carnival is a legendary traveling extravaganza that visits worlds across the multiverse once every eight years. Part circus, part fairy market, part fever dream—the carnival exists somewhere between joy and melancholy, wonder and warning. Those who attend rarely leave unchanged, and some leave with less than they came with.

The carnival travels through the planes on paths known only to its proprietors, appearing at twilight and vanishing before dawn feels quite real. It serves as a bridge between the mortal realm and the Feywild, carrying passengers, secrets, and occasionally stolen things in both directions.

## Appearance
From a distance, the carnival appears as a cluster of warm lights hovering in the dark—too round and too saturated to be natural. Striped tents in purples, greens, and golds rise like fabric mountains, connected by strings of lanterns that seem to breathe. The air smells of sawdust, kettle-corn, and something sweet that visitors can never quite name.

Music drifts from everywhere and nowhere, sometimes skipping backward to correct itself. The carnival's relationship with time is... performative at best.

## Key Features

### The Welcome Gate
An arch of painted moons and glowing lights marks the entrance. All visitors must pass through the ticket booth, where admission is free—though nothing at the Witchlight Carnival is ever truly free.

### The Big Top
The main attraction, where spectacular performances occur nightly. Acrobats, exotic creatures, and acts that defy natural law fill the tent with wonder.

### Staff-Only Areas
Behind the public attractions lies a network of wagons and restricted areas where carnival staff live and work. These areas hold secrets that the proprietors guard carefully.

### Hall of Illusions
A mirror maze that shows visitors reflections of themselves—sometimes as children, sometimes as strangers, sometimes with names written across their foreheads that aren't their own.

## The Proprietors

### Mister Witch and Mister Light
The carnival is operated by a pair of elves whose origins are unclear and whose intentions are never fully transparent.

- **Mister Witch** is composed and calculating, with eyes that track everything and reveal nothing. He handles the business side of operations and maintains order with quiet authority.

- **Mister Light** is bright and theatrical, always performing even in conversation. His cheerfulness sometimes strains at the edges, like a smile held too long.

They speak in rhymes when it suits them and deflect questions with practiced ease:

> "Silly little screeching cricket—you forgot to buy a ticket."
>
> "The carnival goes round and round. The multiverse is our playground. Nothing's free and nothing's lost. Every visit has its cost."

## Notable Staff

- **Candlefoot** - A performer who leads musical acts. Cannot speak directly but communicates through song and gesture.
- **Dirlagraun** - A displacer beast who serves as a carnival guardian. Telepathically communicates with those she trusts.
- **Burly** - Carnival muscle, handles situations requiring physical presence.
- **Thaco** - A balloon artist known for his creative (and sometimes inappropriate) creations.
- **Northwind** - Distributes gifts to visitors during opening ceremonies.

## The Cost of Admission

Though tickets are technically free, visitors often lose something during their time at the carnival—sometimes without realizing it until years later. Common losses include:

- The ability to keep secrets
- The ability to smile
- Artistic creativity
- Cherished childhood possessions
- Sense of direction
- Three inches of height

These losses can be recovered, but the carnival's proprietors are "decidedly unhelpful" about explaining how.

## Connections to the Feywild
The Witchlight Carnival maintains complicated relationships with Feywild powers. At various times, the carnival has been:

- A neutral zone between fey courts
- A transport vessel for travelers seeking the Feywild
- Under the influence of the Hourglass Coven
- A refuge for those fleeing fey politics

When operating in the Feywild, the carnival sometimes becomes "tethered" to local powers—arrangements that Mr. Witch and Mr. Light do not discuss willingly.

## Regional Instances

The carnival manifests differently depending on where and when it appears:

### Thither Manifestation
When the carnival visits the Thither region of Prismeer, it takes on a defensive posture. Some tents are roped off, some lanterns remain dark, and staff smiles are thinner. The carnival operates under an uneasy arrangement with local powers.

## Themes and Atmosphere
- **Wonder with an edge** - Everything is magical, but magic always has a price
- **Nostalgia and loss** - The carnival evokes childhood memories tinged with regret
- **Performance as reality** - Time, space, and truth all bend to narrative convenience
- **Fey bargains** - Every interaction might be a deal; every gift might be a trade

## Notes for DM
- The carnival serves as a consistent touchstone across the campaign
- Mr. Witch and Mr. Light know more than they reveal—use them as mysterious information brokers
- Lost things create personal hooks for player characters
- The carnival can appear whenever dimensional travel or fey connections are needed
- Staff members make excellent recurring NPCs with their own stories

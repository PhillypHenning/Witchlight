# Baba Yaga - The Mother of Hags

## Overview
Baba Yaga is the legendary archfey hag, mother of countless hags including the three sisters of the Hourglass Coven (Bavlorna, Skabatha, and Endelyn). She is immensely powerful, ancient beyond measure, and operates on a scale far beyond mortal concerns. Despite her fearsome reputation, she has shown curiosity and even a degree of fondness toward the party.

## Appearance
- Crooked, hunched figure
- Long white hair brushed back in clumps
- Large, warty nose
- Deep yellow eyes
- Overall ancient and terrifying presence

## Iconic Features
- **The Walking Hut**: Her cottage stands on a pair of enormous chicken legs, capable of walking through any terrain. The hut's arrival is heralded by thunderous footsteps that shake the earth and part trees.
- **Presence**: Her arrival smothers the air with palpable power; even her daughters treat her with wary respect.

## Power Level
- One of the most powerful beings in the Feywild, if not all planes
- Her daughters (the Hourglass Coven) conquered an entire domain, yet they defer to her
- Capable of shrinking creatures with a wave of her hand
- Can sense disturbances across planes (felt Zalbina's cottage reappear in the fog)
- Her problems are "much larger than mortal concerns"

## Family Relationships

### The Hourglass Coven (Biological Daughters)
- **Bavlorna Blightstraw**: Rules Hither, the swamplands
- **Skabatha Nightshade**: Rules Thither, the enchanted forest
- **Endelyn Moongrave**: Rules Yon, the frozen wasteland

Baba Yaga's relationship with her daughters is complex. She recognizes their accomplishments in conquering Prismeer but hints at displeasure over their treatment of Zalbina. She openly antagonizes them, particularly Endelyn, finding amusement in their reactions.

### Zalbina (Adopted Daughter)
- The original ruler of Prismeer before the Hourglass Coven imprisoned her
- Baba Yaga was particularly fond of Zalbina, "to the chagrin of her many sisters"
- When she sensed Zalbina's cottage reappear in the fog, she came immediately to investigate
- Was disappointed to find only the party and not her missing daughter
- Suspects her biological daughters hid Zalbina somewhere

## The Cottage Encounter

### First Meeting with the Party
The party encountered Baba Yaga at Zalbina's cottage in the fog between domains:

1. **Arrival**: The party was exploring Zalbina's cottage when Baba Yaga's walking hut approached, its chicken-leg footsteps shaking the house
2. **Recognition**: Upon entering, she remarked "I'm surprised to find you here, oh I quite liked you when I visited," suggesting she had observed or met them before
3. **Shrinking**: When Endelyn arrived unexpectedly, Baba Yaga shrunk the party to the size of salt shakers to hide them
4. **Confrontation with Endelyn**: The two exchanged veiled threats and cryptic words about Zalbina
5. **Party Assessment**: She demonstrated knowledge of each party member's true nature

### What She Knows About the Party
Baba Yaga called out each party member by epithets that reveal deeper truths:
- **Yanaba**: "Yanaba of many things"
- **Di**: "Di the undecided"
- **Sevro**: "Sevro the false king"
- **Karag**: "Karag the forgotten heir of twilight"
- **Seren**: "Seren the time walker"

She dismissed their ability to help her: "I doubt you can help me, the problems I face are much larger than the mortal concerns you are capable of."

## Personality Traits
- **Amused**: Finds entertainment in antagonizing her daughters, particularly Endelyn
- **Cryptic**: Speaks in riddles and partial truths
- **Dismissive**: Views mortals as beneath her concern, though not with hostility
- **Protective**: Ensured the party's safety by hiding them from Endelyn
- **Nostalgic**: Clearly misses Zalbina and seeks her return
- **Patient**: Operates on timescales incomprehensible to mortals

## Motivations
- Find and potentially free her adopted daughter Zalbina
- Monitor (and occasionally antagonize) her biological daughters
- Address unnamed problems "much larger than mortal concerns"
- Preserve Zalbina's cottage and memories

## Known Abilities
- **Transmutation Magic**: Shrunk the entire party with a casual hand gesture
- **Planar Awareness**: Sensed Zalbina's cottage appearing in the fog from great distance
- **Animated Servants**: Commands phantom hands, enchanted objects, and other magical servants
- **The Walking Hut**: Her mobile home on giant chicken legs
- **Intimidation**: Even Endelyn, ruler of Yon, backs down from direct confrontation

## Relationship with the Hourglass Coven
The Coven fears and respects their mother while simultaneously resenting her favoritism toward Zalbina. Endelyn specifically:
- Arrived at Zalbina's cottage immediately upon sensing it
- Threatened to burn it "to salt and ash"
- Was rebuked by Baba Yaga's calm confidence
- Ultimately retreated rather than escalate

Baba Yaga mocks her daughters' schemes: "I would have thought a witch of your power along with your sisters would have seered this potential happening. Tsk Tsk, I give you too much credit it seems."

## Potential Future Involvement

### The Zalbina Question
Baba Yaga seeks her adopted daughter and may become an ally—or at least not an obstacle—if the party works toward freeing Zalbina from wherever the Hourglass Coven has hidden her.

### Karag's Curse
There is potential that Baba Yaga could be persuaded to help with Karag's curse from Bavlorna, though she showed no direct interest during their meeting.

### Warning About Endelyn
Endelyn noticed the party during the cottage confrontation (some failed stealth checks). Her "deep, dark yellow eye with the pupil of a snake" stared at them as she left. This may have consequences.

## Notable Quotes
- "Daughters are such a handful."
- "She isn't the first nor will be the last of my problems I suspect. He He He He."
- "I doubt you can help me, the problems I face are much larger than the mortal concerns you are capable of."
- To Endelyn: "I wouldn't dare do such a thing." (dripping with sarcasm)
- "I would see the cottage stay as I remember her in it."
- "See you next time darlings."

## Notes for DM

### Running Baba Yaga
- She should feel ancient and alien—not evil per se, but operating on incomprehensible scales
- Her amusement at mortal struggles is genuine but not cruel
- She protected the party not out of kindness but because it suited her purposes
- Her daughters fear her; this fear should be palpable in any encounter involving both

### Plot Hooks
- **Finding Zalbina**: Baba Yaga would be a powerful (if disinterested) ally in this quest
- **Information Source**: She knows secrets about the Hourglass Coven that could be invaluable
- **Karag's Heritage**: Her epithet "forgotten heir of twilight" hints at deeper knowledge about Karag's past
- **Future Visits**: Her parting words "See you next time darlings" suggest future encounters are likely

### Power Level Considerations
- Baba Yaga should never be fought; she is beyond the party's capability
- Her involvement should be as a force of nature—unpredictable, powerful, operating by her own rules
- If she helps, it will be because it aligns with her goals, not because she was persuaded

### The Walking Hut
- Use the hut's arrival as a set piece: shaking ground, parting trees, thunderous chicken footsteps
- The hut is as much a character as Baba Yaga herself
- Its interior contains wonders and horrors beyond the cottage they explored

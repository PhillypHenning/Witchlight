# Descriptions
1. Arrival in Hither
The mist pouring from the mirror seems to claw its way across the ground and grab on to your legs. In a sudden motion you're lifted and pulled towards the mirror. You look down and just as your legs are about to crash into the glass.. they pass right through, as if into water. First your legs, then your midsection and finally as it gets to your head you take a deep breath before being plunged in.

You slowly open your eyes and find yourself in the middle of a maelstorm that violently twists and turns all around you. You look up to see the mirror suspended in space, through it Mr. Light waves and Mr. Witch stares on at you. You look down and see a green round object quickly approaching.

While you fall you feel your body hit unseen barriers. First you smell the color yellow, its radiating cheer like a sweet candy in your nose. Next you hear Wednesday osalate beside you, the hump day starting, peaking and receeding then starting again in the tone of midweek. After that you taste a violent duel of swords. The clash of metal sending pangs of sour to the back of your mouth, the tension of muscle an explosion of heat and the sweet taste of victory as the enemy crumbles to the ground. Finally you see a curious pair of distracted individuals. A massive sperm whale and a bowl of petunias falling together as if mid conversation.

The green that was below you is now upon you and you fall through a glistening and circular opening into some a new green space. 

And with a thud thud thud, you each land in awkwardly bent positions on a cold stone.

2. From up this high
You stand up to find yourselves standing 1000 feet in the sky on a broken stone column surrounded by miles and miles of deep green swamp land. A thick mist hangs in the air obscuring the ground below in most places but even from here you can see many wonderous and curious things. A slanted tower leans precariously on its side nearby. The stump of a massive tree overlooks a opening in the brush, its roots acting as highways through the thick brown muds that surround it. Far off you see a mountain range that seems to split two large bodies of water, holding them away as if it was the mediator between a great fight. Black smoke pours out from the chimney of a large hut and by it a strange house seems to be crawling across the ground.

3. An out of control balloon
    - From far away you hear the sound of air rushing around feathers, then a very bassy thud. 
    
    - From far away you hear a strange rushing of air. Then suddenly not so far away you hear the sound of air rushing out of something. *Wooooosh* overhead a strange looking cloth balloon rockets threw the air, from it you hear a shrill scream. The balloon passes overhead, spinning around in the air frantically as if drunk trying to find its feet. It rips to the left, then right, then back left before like a vollyball spiking downward. Three moments later you hear a tremendous crash and as you look out from the columns edge, you see the balloon is now drapped over the slanted tower.

4. A stork in trouble
    - From above the clouds you hear a tremendous "honk" vibrates the air around you, your bones shuttering from the sheer power of it. Confused you begin looking around.
    
    - A long necked, white bird frantically dives out of the clouds its neck bent backwards to look behind it and its wings beating hard against the air.
    A moment later a gigantic, white, multi-headed goose explodes from the cloud behind the small white bird. Some of its head snap at the heels of the smaller creature, while others snake this way and that keeping an eye on every direction around the beast.
    
    - The white bird, now dwarfed by the massive creature, flies steadily towards you, as it does you can see it has a cloth bundle in its beak and a blue bandana wrapped around its neck. The creature desperately dodges this way and that as the multiple heads snap at the stork whom dive bombs down into the thick trees just below the mist swiftly followed by its massive pursuer. A tremendous crash and the sounds of thick wood bowing and breaking jolts threw the air. A moment later the stork emerges out of the thick trees, its bundle no longer in beak. The creature flies slow and penitently cocks its head back to the thick trees where he emerged.. watching for its pursuer who doesn't emerge after it.

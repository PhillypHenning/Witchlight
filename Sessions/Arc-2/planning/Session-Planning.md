# Session 1
1. Arrival in Hither
2. Stuck on the top of the broken bridge
3. The climb down
    - The party sees a Stork flying with a small package in it's mouth. A giant dragonfly attacks the stork forcing it to take evasive actions. The stork does lose its pursuerer by loses his small package as well. This should be ran while the party is still on the top of the bridge column as Nuff is the only character who can fly and so he will be the only one with agency to check out what has happened. If he does, he will find a small human baby swaddled in cloth stuck in a tree.
    - The party who are still climbing will see the balloon hitting the tower scene
4. When they get to the ground they will hear calls and shouts from creatures that are approaching. The Herrigans will be speaking in Sylvan. 

---
The party will need to pass by Aargon's hideout, when they do the group will be faced with an extremly hard challenge in which all of Aargon's forces will attack the group with the intention of knocking them out. 

If the players are knocked out they will be split up:
    - Sevro, Nuff and (Tristan) will be brought to Myers cottage and throw in his cage.
    - Di and Karag being larger will wake up in a transportation cage being pulled by 2 giant snails. They are being brought to Myers cottage. 
    - Yanaba will wake up in Aaragon's hideout (if she hasn't been to rude) where the Herrigon's will question who she is, where she is from and if she'd like to join their group.

- The point of this encounter is for the group to figue out a way out of their respective cages.
    - Myers will arrive home and will be stalking around upstairs. The cottage group will need to find a way out of their cage and around Myers. 
    - The transport group will need to figure out how and when to get out of their moving cage.
    - Yanaba will need to figure out how to appease the Harrigans to give her an opportunity to get out

---
After Nuff has had some time with the baby he will encounter the Stork (perhaps at the Inn?) responsible for the baby. He will beg for to have the little one back so he can complete his delivery.

    - If Nuff gives him the baby what does he get?
    - If Nuff doesn't give the baby back what would happen?

# Ideas
1. Hans the Stork
    - Nuff storyline
2. Myers the Ogre
    - Low level boss for the party to deal with
3. Jewels the artist (Satyr)
    - Is potentially saved early on in Hither and becomes a constant frienemy of the group
4. Aargon and Yanaba
    - Aargon is confused about Yanaba. Harrigon are all raised in The Burrows, yet Aargon has never seen her before
    - This will provide Yanaba a potential place to check out. The Burrow is a large Harrigon establishment that expands from Hither to Thither. Yanaba will be allowed to enter, however the rest will not.
5. Between two hills is Jewels
    - Jewels will reach out to the party in need of help. An old friend of his is in a bit of trouble and Jewels needs their help to rescue him. This is a lie however, Jewels is really just interested in stealing the moonshine from a pair of Hill Giants and will promptly ditch the party the moment he has what he needs, unless there is more to gain.
6. 

7. The night of yearning (Probably set this in Thither)
    - The party will be offered to join Jewels to a massive party being held at the crest


## Session x

### Mermaid cave
- Brine (Brin) is a Mermaid who was long ago trapped in her watery cave beneath the waterfall and has long since given up on getting back to the sea.
- During her 2 decades of life in the waterfall pools she has amassed a small cult following of crabs who all worship Brine as their watery deity. Twice a week the group of crabs will come and dance for Brine and offer her small trickets and shells they've found over the past few days.

- Shortly after Jewels is initially saved, he will disappear out of the groups sight and end up here. When the party arrives Jewels is being manhandled by a larger crab as the dozen or so other crabs around him sway and speak seamingly say something.

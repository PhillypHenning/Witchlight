1. Caught in the raising tide
    - As the players are traveling they will start run into a Gushing O-Well. The collecting liquids will begin saturating the ground and eventually will force them to find shelter.
    
    - Mention how the mud seems to be getting thicker and more liquid with every step the group takes. Each footstep left behind fills with water within a few seconds
    - As they trudge their way into a clearing, they can see a old Well in the middle of the clearing with a torrent of liquid bellowing forth.

    - The water doesn't seem to be slowing down and looking down they see a small bit of water beginning to collect on the top of the ground. 
        
    - Have them all roll an Atheletics check
        - The lowest roll triggers a "quick sand trap"
        - <10 the player will be stuck in the mud
        - >11 the player is able to move at half speed and their actions are hindered
        - >20 the player can move and act as normal

        - Each turn the player stuck in quicksand will be sucked in 1d4 feet. They can free themselves with a successful strength saving throw of 10 + the number of feet they've sank in
        - A party memeber who is able to move is able to help try and pull them out. 
            - Upon reaching within 10 feet of the party member stuck in the quicksand, they will need to make a strength saving throw (dc 10) or begin getting sucked in themselves.
            - Creatures who are hindered can help the trapped party member with a strength saving throw of 10 + (number of feet sank)
            - Creatures who aren't hindered can help the trapped party member with a strength saving throw of 5 + (number of feet sank)
        
        - Trees in the surrounding area can climb up nearby trees to reach safety while the water levels rise.
        

    - Once the water has risen to a few feet the party members will be stuck up the tree for a bit. This will be a good time to run an RP moment.

    - After some time run the Bullywog Fisher encounter from the expanded material.

3. The crystaline cave
    - Somewhere hidden within Prismeer a crystal cavern calls out to be investigated. The walls and floor of the cavern are made of emerald enticing outsiders to venture into its bowels, at the heart of the cave is a magnificient emerald jewel held fast by a rock formation reaching from the ceiling and floor. 
    Those who venture to far in however find themselves stuck as when they try and leave the entrance they used is now gone. 

    - The cave is alive and feeds on creatures that venture into it like a venus flytrap. The cave isn't sentient. The emerald in the middle acts as a conduict of magic and over time the cave itself has gained a small degree of consciousness.

    - The magic at play makes it so illusion magic when viewed becomes increasingly real. So the trick is to walk out of the cave without looking.

    - Rewards
        - A flawless emerald jem

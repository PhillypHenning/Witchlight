# Game Reminders
1. Karag has the cursed shield on him and still doesn't know it yet
2. Sevro has been randomly teleported somewhere by the magic of the Inn at the end of the Road

# Recap
- The session began with the budding friendship of Tsu and Di as they finished up the repairs on the Inn. Tsu appreciative of Di's help showed him how to tickle metal and provided him with a strange feather. (I need to add this item to Di's inventory)
    - Di wondered to himself where a feather such as this could come from

- Next Fleetwood burst from the ktichen with plates of food in hand and began serving
    - During dinner Karag started a food fight
    - Yanaba inquired Hans the Stork on her potential origins
    - Hans the stork begged Sevro and Nuff to return his charge to him lest he be fired, he then offered and alternative solution
    - Tempest off handly told Karag that he was cursed
    
- Di, effected by the Grung poison became increasingly ill. Seeing her new friend in need, Tsu brought him up to her room to let him bath and rest in peace.

- After dinner Fanny brought Sevro upstairs for the evening.

- The party slept (long rest)

- Waking up in the morning the group met in the dinning room downstairs, as they worked through their breakfast Sevro came down.. The party was surprised to see instead of the short elf.. Sevro had been turned into a donkey. 

- Darrow made a rude remark which set Sevro off.. and in a blink he disappeared from the inn. 

- The party exited the inn onto an old stone path and after their goodbyes the Inn stood back up and began to travel away.

- The session concluded with the cut scene of Karag whom stood staring at an old, ruined church long ago retaken by nature at the end of the path. A massive pool of water slowly draining to create a river that swept a long the old path before them. At the top of the hill, where the old church stood, a massive black entrance into the earth stands forbodding yet beckoning.

# Beats

1. [REWIND] Hans the Stork
    - Hans is desperate to keep his job and the Herrigon child's delivery is the only way to ensure it.
    - Hans initially will beg to have the child returned to him
    - Hans will then counter offer, meet him at the Burrows with the child to complete the delivery
    - If both the above options fail, Hans will resort to attempting to steal the child in coming sessions (during danger)

2. [RP_ENCOUNTER] Introduce Hank Hill
    - As the party watch the Inn fade away into the forest, and Karag stares into the dark entrance off in the distance
        - "Well. That was pretty strange.. can't say I've ever seen that before I'll tell you qwhat"
        - As the party look over a strange man will be standing beside the path
        - Before the party landed directly beside him Hank was on his way to Bullywog town of Downfall.. though he may have gotten a bit lost.

3. The path forward
    - Grendal and his hunting party happened to be camping a short distance away between the party and the dark entrance
    - Grendals company consists of:
        - Grendal and his Flail Snail
        - 4 Snail Riders (Spearmen)
        - 12 Bowman
        - 8 short swordman
        - 4 Net carriers
    
    - Grendal is already informed his unit that he wants all of them caught alive, as such the Herrigons will begin non-lethal attacks after a player is 1/3 health and if they go down, they've been instructed to grab them and drag them off.

    - [ENCOUNTER] The Herrigon have split up into smaller groups with Grendal making camp at the base of the small river. If any of the groups see someone they will sound the alarm. 

    - [ENCOUNTER] The bridge the party first travel over is a Spanner in disguise. If a player travels over the bridge it will awaken. It's eye stalks slowly rising from the ground. In Fey it will announce loudly that "Crossing a bridge without paying anything is rude.. and he doesn't like rude individuals."
        1. The Spanners voice carries, if the conversation carries on a group of Herrigon will begin approaching to investigate.
        2. If the attack happens the Spanner will panic and begin bucking everyone off, laughing like a madman as he does
        3. Spanners like trinkets and baubles, any will do!    

4. Session wrap up
    - Sevro's cutscene

# Cut scenes
The scene opens with an ethereal glow emanating from a swirl of translucent, blue hues. The spellbind fades, revealing Sevro, in finely stitched leather armor, stepping gracefully into the dense, shadowy forest.

The towering ancient tree canopies interlace, their branches forming a natural roof that conceals the sky. Crickets chirp melodiously, leaves rustle with unseen life, and the distant hoot of an owl punctuates the eerie calm. Small creatures dart between bushes, their eyes glinting in the scant twilight that filters through.

Sevro takes a cautious step forward, his hand instinctively gripping the lute strapped to his back. His eyes, sharp and wary, scan the surroundings as he breathes in the damp, mossy air.

Behind him, the entrance of a dark cave looms ominously, shrouded in shadow and foreboding. The cave seems to swallow the light around it, a black maw in the heart of the forest.

Suddenly, two thickly muscled arms, veined and grotesque with claws the color of midnight, slowly extend from the caveâ€™s abyss, slicing through the air with a chilling precision. The claws glint menacingly, their sharp tips thirsting for flesh.

Unaware of the impending danger, Sevro continues to survey his surroundings, senses straining to pick up any sign of movement. A distant growl rustles the leaves, causing him to tense and reach for his lute, ready to strum a defensive spell.

As his fingers hover over the strings, an unsettling whisper of wind reaches his pointed ears. His instincts flare. **Sevro turns, eyes wide with realization**, the monstrous arms lunge from the darkness.

# Recap
- Yanaba
    - Woke up in a dusty storeroom with her arms bound. A white rabbit her sentry, sat infront of her widdling a small figure
    - The white rabbit turns out to be Aagron, the leader of the Blue Scarf gang
    - During their conversation, Yanaba secretly untied herself
    - Their conversation consisted of Aagron explaining
        - how it was the parties fault that his gang just became more dangerous after they killed the female rabbit when first arriving in Hither
        - that the party was each being dealt with in various ways and places
        - that the party misunderstood the situation playing out in the swamp, specifically whom he was, as Aaragon put it, "He's the only reason the Herrigon of the swamp are respected and aren't eaten by the more dangerous creatures
    - As the conversation began to wrap up massive explosions began rocking the building. Aaragon told Yanaba to "head to The Burrows" if she wants to see the truth for herself before throwing a stone at her which transported her to a small room with 2 doors
    - The 2 doors both said the other was lying and that they were the only way out
    - The session ended with Yanaba reaching for the handle of the right door

- Sevro
    - Sevro having just poofed out of the Inn at the end of the Road found himself on a strange hillside
    - He had enough time to take in his surroundings before being ambushed from behind by a strange, very dumb creature
    - Sevro and the creature fought briefly before Sevro climbed up a tree and away from the dumb beast
    - A woman's voice called over towards the noise of battle and shortly after a strange goblin covered in chains and locks appeared, a moment after that so did Jewels
    - The woman swatted of the dumb creature and introduced herself, Jewels and Raagpggmaragh to their new guest
    - Jewels remarked how Sevro was a lot like his best friend Sevro except he was more hairy, Donkey Sevro played along
    - Jingle Jangle the strange goblin asked if Sevro was interested in coming with her and her rag-tag group as they were going to "blow someone up" and with excitement, Donkey Sevro agreed
    - The 4 of them travelled through the swamp for 2 days
        - During the travel Jewels showed a Donkey Sevro a piece of art he had been working on, Jewels was insecure about showing his friends the piece but with Donkeys Sevro kind and encouraging words, he managed to convince Jewels to show it to them next time he saw them
    
- Karag and Di
    - Karag and Di wake up in a wooden cage being pulled by 2 giant snails. A herrigon leads the snails from shellback, while a persession of herrigon walk beside their wooden cage cart.
    - A short distance behind them is the tip of the old church just poking up and out of the trees, clearly they hadn't yet gotten very far
    - The Herrigon pull the cage over and begin to make camp in a small clearing
    - While camped out, Karag and Di work together to begin breaking their way out of their enclosure
        - Di casting Thamaturgy to create a distraction and Karag slowly breaking a hole into the wooden cage
    - The distraction gets much more distracting when a enormous horned frog jumps out from the treeline and into the clearing
        - The herrigon all make a run for it into the trees
        - The horned frog quickly begins gulping down the giant snail
    - While the giant frog is distracted Karag and Di manage to break a large enough hole in their containment and make a beeline for the treeline, just barely taking cover as the giant frog begins looking around for it's continued snack
        - With a quick few bounds, the frog is out of the clearing and chasing down the fleeing herrigon
    - Taking the opportunity, Karag and Di make their way back to the church
        - While there, Karag follows the strange feeling he's been having into the strange tunnel opening that the church had seemingly been built around long ago
            - Deep in the ground Karag conversed with Grumbar whom told him the 3 teachings of stone
        - Di, up above ran into Maraunu and Tempest
            - Maraunu struck up a conversation while Tempest went to the mouth of the cave to meet with Karag
        - As Karag left, Tempest offered to extract the curse from his body, to which Karag agreed to
        - Marunu became more pushy about Di staying away from Tempest and Karag which put him on edge
        - The session culminated in Tempest extracting the curse while mentioning that "Only 1 major curse can be put on a person at a time", a moment later a snake like horned frog head darted from the tree line, Karag to slow to react was bit by the strange creature
        - The session ended as Di ran to Karag to figure out what had just happened
            - Additionally - Maraunu's voice entered into Di's head saying "I'm sorry. They have my friend captive, I can't refuse them" before her and Tempest disappear into the forest.

- Nuff and Baraka
    - Nuff and Baraka wake up, bound together, as a Herrigon pours a strange liquid from a purple flower into their mouths
    - Looking around they find themselves in an open air fight pit
    - Nuff easily breaks his bonds and begins to lift into the air with Baraka
    - As the two lift into the air the Herrigon spectators begin to pull weapons out, aside from the swords and spears a few pull out crossbows and let off a volly towards them
    - Baraka takes 2 of the shots and unfortunately plummets back to the ground
    - Nuff flies out of the pit, bolts flying around him, yelling a tearful apology, the small fairy takes off for the treelines and makes it
    - The session ends with Nuff quickly zipping through the forest as the cries of his pursuers slowly fading behind him

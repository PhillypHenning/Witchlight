[COMPLETE]

# Recap
- The party left the confusing creature by the name of Elmer who inhabits Slanty tower. The strange creature was hostile at first but after an exchange of food and understanding, most of the tension between the party was addressed.
    - Before leaving, Elmer requested that the party keep an eye out for his body which he claims is a Hobgoblin.

- The party, now with Sir Talifer the Pixie Pseduo-dragon locked in his cage began to head towards Key Top Mountain, the supposed home of Jingle Jangle. Jingle Jangle was mentioned by Elmer who claimed that Jingle Jangle is a master of keys and locks. The mountain offering a double advantage, perhaps helping Sir Talifer while providing a high point for the party to survey the area further.

- Before the party could put boots to the ground and head towards the mountain, a familiar scream filled the air. Deciding it was best to check in, they soon found their way to small pond where Jewels the Satyr was trapped, surrounded by large and small crabs.
    - They additionally met Rain, a mermaid stuck in the small ponds. Rain sold a few small trinkets to the group. As well, she and Jewels had a brief conversation about the whereabouts of his sister.
    - Yanaba expressed her desire to help Rain if possible someday.

    Additionally reminders
        1. You guys have been awake for 7 hours now. Though you still have more then enough energy to keep going you will need to consider resting in the near future.

2. [RP] A brief conversation
    - Jewels upon noticing Sir Talifer will question the group how they came by him.
    - This is an opportunity for the group to ask questions to Jewels and Sir Talifer.
        - NPC knowledge
            - Sir Talifer
                - Was sent by the Summer Queen to investigate Prismeer as the realm has been quiet and isolated for some time.
                - Was in Bullywog hamlet Downfall where he tried to secure an audience with the Bullywog king. Unfortunately the king whom he was speaking to was killed and he was branded a traitor and sentenced to execution.
                - He was caged and hung from a large tree but before his execution date a rogue Bullywog offered him escape if he would help her overthrow the new king. Sir Talifer agreed and in the dead of night she stole him and a airballoon. The Airballoon smelled god awful. Something happened that Sir Talifer is unsure of and before he knew it he was flying around in the sky sure he'd die. The Bullywog who saved him was throw from the basket.. he is unsure of her whereabouts. 
            - Jewels
                - Having only recently gotten back into Prismeer he isn't really sure of much. He had spent the last few years in Faerun. The story of what he was doing there constantly changing. 
                - He left Prismeer after a "bad job" that left him and his sister as wanted fugitivies.

3. [ENCOUNTER] A path disturbed
    - While walking the path towards Jingle Jangle' mountain the party will run into a tribe of primative Grungs. The Grungs will wait until the party moves further down the path and then ambush them when they get to the middle.
    - The Grungs aren't by nature vicious and instead let their poison immobilize their foes so that they can take what they want from them.
        - If beaten, the party will lose their bags and small arms
        - If they beat a few of the Grungs, then the entire tribe will scatter into the bushes.
        - The encounter should be more of a "run away" moment, then a stand and fight as the Grungs will have a great deal more in numbers.
    - The Grungs have an effigy to the Slackjaw Monster
        - "A large effigy of some strange god is erected using Mud, Sticks, Twine and Bones in the center of the creature make-shift camp. Smaller versions of the same thing are strung in trees and off rocks as well.
    - They worship the Slackjaw Monster, the transformed version of Slackjaw Lorna believing it to have birthed them in this place. They rob what they can of the players is given the opportunity. They will become somewhat hostile and will attack, however don't really seek to kill and will retreat if they themselves begin losing. 
    
4. [CHARACTER] Within the camp is a somewhat desacrated alter, the stone figure ground away to a blank canvas by that passage of time. The figure seems to be holding his hands out within something vaguely round within, but it's hard to even tell that much
    - Karag
        - Karag feels strangely draw to the figure for a few moments
        - Religion check 
            - (10+) With it being in the Fey you have very few ideas to what the figure could be depicting. Your best guess is one of the many ArchFey who rule these outerwilds.
            - (15+) It is custom to decorate ArchFey monuments with flowers. Doing so grants safe travels.
                - If a party member puts flowers down they are granted an inspiration

## Cutscene
The dense forest envelops the party, the canopy above creating a mosaic of flickering shadows. As the group presses forward, the usual forest sounds – the rustling leaves, distant bird calls, and the hum of nature – begin to wane. In their place, a strange and unfamiliar noise grows louder, an unsettling rhythm that hums with intensity.

Thud. Thud. Thud.

At first, it is barely discernible, like the distant beat of a drum. But with each step, it grows louder, gaining a resonance that vibrates through the ground beneath their feet. The rhythmic pounding creates a shiver in the air, tickling the senses, and urging an uneasy curiosity.

Thud. Thud. Thud.

(Pause and let the party react to this.)

The fast, rhythmic footfalls of a great creature with many legs continue. It is a sound ancient, primal, breathing life into the shadows ahead. Tension rises in the party as eyes scan the horizon for the source of this anomaly.

The mist hangs low in the distance, clinging to the undergrowth like ghostly tendrils. And then, parting the veil of mist and foliage, emerges a colossal form, mysterious and enchanting. The forest bows back, conceding space for the arrival of something truly otherworldly. 

Thud. Thud. THUD.

a massive red building, perches atop countless large, human-like feet that move in perfect synchrony. The feet, thick and gnarled, pound the forest ground with heavy, deliberate steps. Above, the inn towers, a splendid yet odd contrast to its bizarre mode of locomotion.

The building itself is an architectural marvel – a large, square, red edifice. Windows of warm yellow light flicker through the surrounding trees, beckoning invitingly. Ornate carvings of mythical beasts writhe around the window frames, and lanterns hang from the eaves, radiating a cozy glow. 

Atop the inn, a smoke stack puffs rhythmic plumes of smoke, signaling to the weary traveler the promise of warmth, food, and refuge. The rich, earthy scent of freshly baked bread and roasting meat escapes the inn, mingling with the fresh forest air. 

Just as the inn appears to lumber past the party, it halts with a last resounding thud, its multitude of feet settling under it like roots gripping the soil. A grand wooden sign swings into view, etched in ornate script: "The Inn at the End of the Road."

(The party can choose what to do but if the approach the door)

A solid, ornate door sits as a barrier between the swamp behind you and the universe of possibilities ahead of you. A bronze plaque is inlaid into the wall beside the door, the strange runes written on it seemingly shifting before your eyes. It takes but a moment but the runes transform into.. Common! Written on it:
    1. No tender within. Inquire with Innkeep as to tonight's rates
    2. Harming or the intention to harm anyone within will result in your immediate, random removal
    3. You are to leave when the Inn requests it regardless of the time spent or distance traveled

From within you hear an unfamilar voice loudly boast: 
"For I am Darrow! Have you not heard of me lass?"

And that is where we end for tonight

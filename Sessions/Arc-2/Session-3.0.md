[COMPLETE]

# Recap
1. Party plans out sleeping arrangements
    - Camp
        - Yanaba takes cares of gathering food for everyone (background trait)
        - Di and Karag make the fire
        - Nuff and Sevro make a nest together for themselves and the baby
    - Activities
        - Karag investigated the gourd he acquired from Jabbek, taking back his memory and reviewing the others
        - Sevro went looking for "milk" to which he found Fanny who invited him to a romp in the woods. He declined as he something felt off that he couldn't put his finger on.
    - Established a watch order + whether they do so in or out of gear

2. The bog drained
3. They heard screams off in the distance and investigated. They stumpled upon a Shambling Mound mid attack on a Satyr. This is where Session 3 picks up


# Beats
1. The session begins as the Shambling Mound falls lifeless to the ground. It's metal like head lifting one last time desperately before falling with a thump to the ground.
    - Baraka comes through the brush nearby
    - Karag's snail comes heaving up slowly

2. Jewels
    - Jewels is extremely thankful for the parties help.
        - "Would have been paying the tollman 2 coins if it weren't for you lot, you have my thanks"
        - What he knows
            - He knows about the Slackjaw Monster
            - He knows about Aargaon and the Bluescarf gang, though he avoids them
            - He knows about Shronk, though doesn't bring him up unless there is a reason to
            - He knows about Jingle Jangle
            - If Sevro is Sevro, then he will warn him of his sister, but only if he can guess her name. If pushed he will give Sevro the hint: "Green are the leaves that hang from my limbs, abundant shrubbery below larger trees. That's probably a hiku or something."
                - If he does guess her name (Fanny Bush). Bush is good enough and he will explain her full name.
        - What he likes
            - beer
            - woman
            - little cured meats
        - What he dislikes
            - Cheese. Stuff stinks

    - He recently found out from a loose lipped Bullywug that his sister, Fanny, is in the area. The last time Jewels and Fanny masqueraded as trinket inspectors and they tricked the King of _(Bullywugs)_ to give them his trinkets. Before anyone knew it the two had skipped town.. Jewels hasn't seen her since and wishes to reconnect. (Jewels hasn't seen her since because Fanny was captured and was locked up, only very recently being released and making her way South.)
    - Jewels will stick around the party until Slanty Towers or appropriate, at which point he will disappear

3. Boom Shroom Field

4. Fork in the woods
- There are 2 obvious paths and 1 hidden path to choose from.
    - One hardened path continues towards rolling muddy hills. Off in the distance long metal poles with tattered cloth dot the horizon
    - The other hardened path leads downward beside a river. Off in the distance you see tree sized mushrooms, the beginning of a large forest
    - The hidden path is walking down the river which leads to a underground cave entrance

5. [CHOICE] Muddy Battlefield
6. [CHOICE] Mushroom Forest

7. Slanty Tower

# Special Combat Encounters
## The Tollway

The Tollway is swarming with Herrigon, most are in small parties (2-3) within and up to the boarder of The Tollways entrances looking for the escapys, while another small and battered group is running towards the Hideout after being attacked by the Giant Toad.

1. Undected
- Outside the Tollway
    Every hour a patrol walks through the border area. Unless they push up and stay the treeline this won't be an issue. 
- Inside the Tollway
    It would take an hour of slow, cautious movement to move through the swamp. Which will require 6 stealth checks to accomplish. The DCs of which are: 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15

2. Once detected then combat begins
    - The Herrigon will prioritizing sounding the alarm before engaging. Once the alarm is issued they will attempt to fall back and wait for more until to arrive.

3. Combat

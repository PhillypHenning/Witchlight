# Special Combat Encounters
## The Tollway

The Tollway is swarming with Herrigon, most are in small parties (2-3) within and up to the boarder of The Tollways entrances looking for the escapys, while another small and battered group is running towards the Hideout after being attacked by the Giant Toad.

1. Undected
- Outside the Tollway
    Every hour a patrol walks through the border area. Unless they push up and stay the treeline this won't be an issue. 
- Inside the Tollway
    It would take an hour of slow, cautious movement to move through the swamp. Which will require 6 stealth checks to accomplish. The DCs of which are: 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15

2. Once detected then combat begins
    - The Herrigon will prioritizing sounding the alarm before engaging. Once the alarm is issued they will attempt to fall back and wait for more until to arrive.

3. Combat
    Roll a 1d4+1 herrigon to start the combat
    Every minute (10 turns):

## Shronk's hut
- A pair of ogres are working for Lorna The GreatHorned Frog. They used to raid the Herrigon of The Stump and the Burrows not so long ago and are still more than capable to. However Aaragon has so far been able to quell them with an agreement of him supplying live sacrifice. The two are still a dangerous threat and aren't afraid to nab a Herrigon here and there with no recourse.

# Question's left unanswered
- Sir Talifer took Noaba and fled during the battle. Having watched his friends die he was unsure of what to do next. The small pseudo-dragon has done his best to take care of the small child but it entirely unsure how to do that. Luckily Hans the Stork happened upon them, and though at first he did try to convince Talifer to give him the baby so that he could complete his delivery, he soon realized that Sir Talifer was not going to give the baby up. Hans has stuck around and Sir Talifer isn't completly trusting, however Hans has been helping Sir Talifer out with taking care of the baby. They are still planning on what to do next.

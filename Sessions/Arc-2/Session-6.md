# Recap

# Beats
1. The Inn at the End of the Road
    - Di
        - Mention to Di that his armpits are strangely itchy
            - If he sneaks a look he sees that most of his sides are red and bumpy
    - Tsu and Di
        - Tsu is interested in knowing where Di comes from
        - What is he exactly
        - She is thankful for him helping her as the work as long since been due
        - Asks what he is doing in Hither, especially now

        - Tsu knows of the Witch Lorna but due to a pact is unable to communicate anything about her or the pact

        - Once all the legs are in place the inn will suddenly open up to reveal a large mouth. A tongue slides out and gathers up the legs pulling them inside. Meanwhile in Inn will violently shake sending everyone to the floor.

        - Tsu will bring Di downstairs and introduce him to Templeton and his crew. Templeton is an extremely large black/grey rat with intellligent eyes. He will squeek instructions to his crew and they will begin "operating" on the legs.. This work is rather gruesome and bloody.
        
        - Afterwards, Tsu will offer to teach Di how to "make metal laugh" in order to make it stronger claiming, a soul full of laughter is hard to shatter, that goes for metal too."
    
2. Dinner is served
    - Di
        - At some point during this mention to Di that the itchness has escalated quite drastically to heat.

    - Immediately after the legs are eaten up Fleetwood will burst from the kitchen yelling "HUNGRY? COME TO THE DINING ROOM AND GET YOUR DINNER MENU NOW"
        - Pass out the menus and let them select their foods (take notes)
    - This moment brings the entire house together, during the meal have each person roll: d6
        1. As you go to take fork your next bite you pust a littttle to much elbow grease into it and send a good chunk of your dinner flying. Who does it hit?
        2. As you begin to drink your eyes meet with <NAME>.. A smirk hidden behind a cup and determined eyes he tips his cup up higher.. seems like they want to race to the bottom of the cup. (Con checks)
        3. From the other side of the table you hear a voice pipe up "Excuse me, could you please pass the sauce infront of you." As you look down the table most others are far to invested in their meals.. Do you help them and how do you get the sauce down the table?
        4. As you go to put some salt on your food.. the cap falls off and an ungodly amount of salt quickly falls all over your plate.. What do you do?
        5. One of the table apps sits in front of you, feeling peckish you reach in just as the person across from you does the same.. your hands bump in the air and you look up to see them looking at you.. what do you do?
        6. With a phwamp Fwooosh a thick glob of butter sails through the air hitting you dead in the nose. The table erupts in laughter as it slowly slides down your face with little grace. Who do you think threw it?

3. Di is poisoned
    - DC 15 CON for each poison
    - Poisons
        - Blue, Di develops a strange case of the hiccups which aggressively turn into the sounds of different animals

        - Green, If Di attempts to move he instead jumps like a frog
        - Orange, Di begins to have a bad trip
        - Purple, Di gets a really urgent need to submerge himself in water. His skin and eyes feel extremely dry
        - Red, Di is overtaken by hunger to eat flies and gains the ability to sniff them out

4. Kettlesteam
    - Still using Lightfoot's voice, Nuff will recognize it (int check to determine who it belonged to)
    - Kettlesteam is looking for his patron who should be ruling Prismeer
        - His patron is of course the ArchFey Zalbina
    - He's been here only a day longer then the rest of the party and has spent most of his time in the inn
    - He tried to leave Hither by flying through then over the dense fog that surrounds the swamp but each time he ended up back in the swamp somewhere else.
    - Kettlesteam is a bit discouraged at this point and is resting and regaining his composure before he continues his journey
    
    - If the party don't cheer him up, he may fall victim to Maraunu and Tempest who will offer to introduce him to the new matrons of Prismeer

4. Sevro vs Darrow
    - Darrow will challenge Sevro for Fanny's attention much to her delight
    - Since they cannot fight they will need to come up with another method of competition, Darrow suggests they arm wrestle

# Game Reminders
1. Karag has the cursed shield on him and still doesn't know it yet
2. Di is effected by the Grung poison
3. Darrow is racist

# Recap
- You left Rain's watery caverns and made your way back onto the path with Jewels in toe
- While walking the path you tumbled upon a makeshift camp full of Grungs. The small creatures hungerily swarmed Di who got pretty flustered with the ordeal, meanwhile Karag heard the calling of the earth from a statue within the camp.
- Of course. Jewels went missing. Again.
- Finally a travelling inn found its way to you and offered you sanctuary
    - Heading inside you found a large cast of characters
    - Tsu the innkeep and Fleetwood the cook
    - Marunu and Tempest the shadowy individuals
    - Darrow and Fanny the cheerful bunch at the table
- Di was requested to help out Tsu in payment for your lodgings
- Sevro and Darrow immediately began a pissing contest, honestly it's hard to tell who is the bigger ass between them
- Yanaba and Nuff questioned the shadowy figures for details of their lives

# Beats
1. Reminders before the game
    - Karag
        - Ever since the Grung camp you've had a nagging feeling in the back of your mind. Something between a headache and a forgotten memory. You can't shake the feeling that there is something within this place that you're missing. Though you're unsure what that something is.
    - Baraka (If Tristan is here)
        - Replay the entrance to the Inn, specifically with the Rusted Knight seeing him and reacting before being kicked out.

2. The Inn at the End of the Road
    - Di
        - Mention to Di that his armpits are strangely itchy
            - If he sneaks a look he sees that most of his sides are red and bumpy
    - Tsu and Di
        - Tsu is interested in knowing where Di comes from
        - What is he exactly
        - She is thankful for him helping her as the work as long since been due
        - Asks what he is doing in Hither, especially now

        - Tsu knows of the Witch Lorna but due to a pact is unable to communicate anything about her or the pact

        - Once all the legs are in place the inn will suddenly open up to reveal a large mouth. A tongue slides out and gathers up the legs pulling them inside. Meanwhile in Inn will violently shake sending everyone to the floor.

        - Tsu will bring Di downstairs and introduce him to Templeton and his crew. Templeton is an extremely large black/grey rat with intellligent eyes. He will squeek instructions to his crew and they will begin "operating" on the legs.. This work is rather gruesome and bloody.
        
        - Afterwards, Tsu will offer to teach Di how to "make metal laugh" in order to make it stronger claiming, a soul full of laughter is hard to shatter, that goes for metal too."
    
    - At the end of their discussion outside they will hear flapping wings followed by deep laboured breaths. Looking to the sky they will see Hans the stork flying towards them.
        - Hans asks if the Inn is open to which Tsu says it is and he is welcome to head inside
    
3. Dinner is served
    - Di
        - At some point during this mention to Di that the itchness has escalated quite drastically to heat.

    - Immediately after the legs are eaten up Fleetwood will burst from the kitchen yelling "HUNGRY? COME TO THE DINING ROOM AND GET YOUR DINNER MENU NOW"
        - Pass out the menus and let them select their foods (take notes)
    - This moment brings the entire house together, during the meal have each person roll: d6
        1. As you go to take fork your next bite you pust a littttle to much elbow grease into it and send a good chunk of your dinner flying. Who does it hit?
        2. As you begin to drink your eyes meet with <NAME>.. A smirk hidden behind a cup and determined eyes he tips his cup up higher.. seems like they want to race to the bottom of the cup. (Con checks)
        3. From the other side of the table you hear a voice pipe up "Excuse me, could you please pass the sauce infront of you." As you look down the table most others are far to invested in their meals.. Do you help them and how do you get the sauce down the table?
        4. As you go to put some salt on your food.. the cap falls off and an ungodly amount of salt quickly falls all over your plate.. What do you do?
        5. One of the table apps sits in front of you, feeling peckish you reach in just as the person across from you does the same.. your hands bump in the air and you look up to see them looking at you.. what do you do?
        6. With a phwamp Fwooosh a thick glob of butter sails through the air hitting you dead in the nose. The table erupts in laughter as it slowly slides down your face with little grace. Who do you think threw it?

    - Good chance to have Hans see the baby and inquire
        - Upon realizing that this is the same child he is looking for he will ask for his ward back so he can make his properly delivery
        - He is worried about being kicked out of The Nest, and the Blue Delivery Service, his job
        - If not able to convince Nuff / Sevro to give the child back to his care, he will reason that he must steal the child from them
    
    - This will be a good place to have the party kick back, relax and potentially speak to each other. Encourage them to ask questions that may have been on their mind during dinner. 

4. Di is poisoned
    - DC 15 CON for each poison
    - Poisons
        - Blue, Di develops a strange case of the hiccups which aggressively turn into the sounds of different animals

    - Kettlesteam is looking for his patron who should be ruling Prismeer
        - His patron is of course the ArchFey Zalbina
    - He's been here only a day longer then the rest of the party and has spent most of his time in the inn
    - He tried to leave Hither by flying through then over the dense fog that surrounds the swamp but each time he ended up back in the swamp somewhere else.
    - Kettlesteam is a bit discouraged at this point and is resting and regaining his composure before he continues his journey

    - If the party don't cheer him up, he may fall victim to Maraunu and Tempest who will offer to introduce him to the new matrons of Prismeer

# Cutscenes
## Goodbye to new friends
The soft, warm light of the perpetual twilight filters through the ornate windows, casting a glow upon the faces of the patrons as the party gathers their belongings. Kettlestream's gentle melody hums in the background, a farewell lullaby to the adventurers.

**Camera pans across the warm, bustling room, then settles on Tsu the Chameleon Lizardfolk Innkeep.**

**Tsu:**
"Time to part ways, friends," Tsu says, her scales shifting to a tranquil morning hue. "Remember the Inn will always find those who need it."

**Fleetwood, the Fat Blue Dragonborne Cook, waddles over with a large satchel.**

**Fleetwood:**
"Packed you some of my finest for the road. Swamps aren't known for their cuisine," he says with a chuckle, patting the satchel. 

**The camera shifts to Marunu and her partner Tempest.**

Marunu approaches, her eyes glowing softly with a fire, while Tempest stands in the shadows behind her, silent as ever.

**Marunu:**
"I hope we all meet again," a broad genuine smile across Marunu's face

**Fleetwood:**
"Safe travels! And remember, the Inn will always be here," Fleetwood calls out, a fond smile on his lips.

**Tsu:**
"Indeed. Farewell, and may the road treat you kindly," Tsu adds, her voice gentle and reassuring.

The Inn's colossal legs begin to stir, raising it back to its feet.

**The massive red building, perched atop its many human-like legs, moves with a rhythmic grace toward the edge of the forest.**

**Thud. Thud. Thud.**

The forest parts way for the lumbering Inn, and ever so slowly it disappears from view. The sounds of its foot falls slowly trailing away behind the view.

**The camera focuses on the party as they prepare to disembark.**


## A growing presence 
Thick, gnarled trees stretch their limbs overhead, their twisted branches creating a canopy that filters the fading twilight into mottled patches of light and shadow on the ground.

**The camera pans slowly, capturing the dense foliage, the glistening patches of still water, and the occasional croak of a distant frog.**

In the distance, partially obscured by mist and creeping vines, stands the silhouette of a broken down church. Its steeple leans precariously, and shattered stained glass windows flicker as though catching the last glints of sunlight and reflecting memories of a once-sacred place.

**The camera zooms in on the church, emphasizing its ancient, decaying structure amidst the swamp's eerie beauty.**

A sense of age and neglect hangs heavy over the building; moss-covered stones and creeping ivy have claimed much of the outer walls. The large, weathered double doors hang slightly ajar, and beyond them, the interior is shrouded in darkness, hinting at secrets hidden within.

**The camera then hard cuts to a close-up of Karag's face.**

The paladin's eyes are wide with concern, his normally resolute expression betraying a hint of anxiety. Sweat beads on his forehead, and his fingers tighten around his weapon. 

**Karag: A high-pitched ringing sound fills your ears, growing louder and more insistent.**

**The camera then zooms out to show Karag standing motionless, his gaze fixed on the distant church.**

**The camera holds on Karag for a moment, capturing his internal struggle, then pans back to the silhouette of the church.**

**Karag: A few moments of stillness pass and the ringing sound fades, leaving only the eerie silence of the swamp filling your ears**


## Zalbina's rhythm
In the glade where moonbeams play,
Lies a tale of Zalbina’s day,
Deep within the forest glen,
Magic stirs and whispers then.

Zalbina, Zalbina, with eyes so bright,
Dance with shadows in the night,
Weave your spells and cast your might,
In the realm of fey delight.

Once a maid of mortal world,
In the fey, her fate unfurled,
She learned secrets, dark and wild,
With each spell, a cunning child.

Zalbina, Zalbina, sly and keen,
Charmed the crown of Autumn’s Queen,
Trick and treat, and bending seen,
By her wit, she built a dream.

Spiders dance and goblins cheer,
When her laughter they can hear,
Through the woods, a whispered charm,
Shields all fey from mortal harm.

Zalbina, Zalbina, crafty one,
Plays her games till night is done,
In her eyes, a thousand suns,
Trickster’s daughter, fey and fun.

So beware, ye children small,
When you hear her mystic call,
For in dreams she’ll weave you tight,
With her spell of soft moonlight.

Zalbina, Zalbina, ever fair,
Beware her cunning, if you dare,
But with a heart and spirit bare,
You might just see her magic share.


# GAME NOTES
- Sevro has been turned into a donkey and at the very end of the adventure took an action that had him poofed out of the inn
- Yanaba asked Hans if he had lost a baby before and whether it was in the mortal world to which he confessed to (missed opportunity to lie, this is my fault, I should have made it more interactive)
- Di tripped from the Grung poison (failed every CON check.. lel) and Tsu looked after him for the night

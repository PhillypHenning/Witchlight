    - The Shambling Mound

7. Muddy Battlefield
    - An old battlefield its history long since forgotten by all that knew of it.
    - 6 Animated Armors passively surround a longsword, its blade like moonlight that is stuck in a large rock with the remains of an old soldier beside it.
        - The soldier is an old knight, his armor has mostly degraded to nothing

    - Sir Talivarf
        - He will offer his aid to the party. Instead of giving them his dagger he will offer his assistence to the party. If they need his help just crushup a honey truffle and throw it. Sir Talifar likens himself to a useful pig finding truffles in that way.
    - Elmer
        - Knowledgable about 
            - Hither from his time travelling the mud. He worships "Slack Jaw", the giant toad of the swamp.

            - Shronk
                - Knows he is a worshipper of Slack Jaw as well and that he's probably the only creature in the swamp that the Giant Toad creature doesn't try to eat weekly. 
            - Jingle Jangle
                - Knows of the creature who collects all the keys in Hither. Not much more.
        - Elmer doesn't need anything material. He is content with his food and his property within Slanty Towers.
        - If asked he will tell about his back story, and that will get him to mention that he would appreciate his body back and that the last time he paid one of the Bullywogs to spy on "the swamp witch" he was told "his body is in the giant brass toad" for all that's worth.
        - He will let the party speak to Talifar but will not let them approach

            1. His old body back
            2. A beaver as a substitute dinner and the offer doesn't last forever

# Details
## Backed into a corner cutscene
The camera raises from black to beneath the floor, passing dirt, thick roots and finally coming up to the used but well kept flooring of a room full of Herrigons standing about and speaking softly to one another.

Inching further up still, dotted on the walls here and there and maps and notes, beneath are cabinets full of knick knacks, common items and other useful bits. On the far side of the room a figure cloaked in shadows with a long, bright blue scarf sits on a ramshackle throne his head hung loosely in his hand. The soft drone of conversation surrounds him but even from here you can hear his fingers tap* tap* tap* ing on the wood of his arm rest.

A commotion begins in the back as the thick door of their hideout is thrown open and a familiar Herrigon, slung dead between two blood stained archers, is carried in. The camera shifts to beside the shadowed creatures head. The breath in his throat catches as does his tapping. The whole hideout falls silent. Only for a moment though as the spell must be broken.

"What happened" - Aaragon

"We were ambushed near the 22nd Pillar. Jabbek was leading of course, last few days had been easy but then we heard a crack or something in the air and we followed towards it. Not long after a storkin came flying out of the cloud like a lunatic.. rightfully as he was being chased by the Goose Mother. We went in that direction and in there we were ambushed by a group." - Herrigon Archer

"Today is 'posed to be the end of the season of monsters.. Why in all of natures bounty would it send a Goose Mother too!" - Random Herrigon in the crowd

The room once again goes silent and eyes float to the back of the room, the figure in the blue scarf.

"The Goose Mother is hunting, we've seen it here before a few times nothing to worry about." - Aaragon

"Nothing to worry about! Jabbek is dead" - Random figure in crowd

"Folks. Let's keep our heads on for a moment. Who killed Jabbek?" - Aaragon

"Alas it wasn't the Goose Mother, it was when we were ambushed by that group" - Herrigon Archer

Murmurs run through the crowd gathered.

"They attacked with real weapons.. warrior weapons.." - Herrigon Archer

The sparks of fire begin whelling up from the crowd. The blue scarfed figure swiftly stands to his feet. 

"I know where this is about to go and lets just hold on a moment. Who was this group?" - Aaragon

"Never seen them before, judging by how they fought in the mud though, they haven't been here long." - Herrigon Archer

"Is there nothing else??" - Aaragon

The sparks of the crowd again catching, this time sending ripples of shouts across those gathered.

"Err.. uh.. They were an orc.. a giant turtle.. a fairy and.. a herrigon?" - Herrigon Archer

The shadowy figure turns away for a moment, the camera follows. His eyes pass from side to side and he mumbles "a herrigon?" before his composure snaps and the figure turns back to the hot crowd. 

"Fine. I know it's coming so let's hear it." - Aaragon

"We want the deal. We want real weapons for the Blue Scarf gang. This is the biggest loss to our company yet. Grundy doesn't even know yet! Lords who will tell him.." - The crowd

"I will tell Grundy, everyone here keep your yappers zipped and you in the back and those who go on guard, prioritity order, get me the moment you see him returning.

As for the weapons. We've always done things here in The Tollway a certain way.. however times have changed, the swamp gets more dangerous with every passing sleep. I'm tired of losing my friends as much as anyone else here.. I'll put the order in all of you will have real weapons in your hands.

The crowd cheers, jumping and chattering with glee. Many of the herrigon figures play fight with each other, mocking valiant strikes and glorious deaths. The blue scarf figure slumps into his throne and a moment later, *tap *tap *tap "A herrigon"


Captain Bluescarft

## Baraka re-entrance
The portal opens below you Baraka as you tumble out head over heeks and into a knee deep pool of watery mud. You lay there a moment, the sounds of the swamp around you setting in like a barb in a thumb.

From behind you hear a meaty *Whack* followed by a pained groan. You pull your body and arms free you look towards the noise. About 35 feet away from you a man in a terrible suit of thick rust menancingly hovers over a crumpled body on the ground. Griped tightly in his hands, slouched on his shoulder is a massive horrific thing. A great club made out of dozens and dozens of humanoid arms.

The creatures muscles explode in motion, the tip of the club lifts up 12 feet into the air, then comes striking down on the already motionless flesh. It reaches down and roughly grabs the arm of the man, then plants a boot on its ribcage before sharply yanking, the sound of senew stretching and bones snapping. "Vile creature." a voice tangs from within the rusted bucket on his head. He takes the arms and strikes the bloody shoulder ball into his club. "Show me the next one" and the arms on the club all twist and point in the same direction. Without hesitation the creature begins to walk away.

## Boom Shrooms
You find yourself in a forest of Mushrooms, it happens slowly until all at once it dawns on you that all around you are mushrooms in a huge variety of different colors, shapes and sizes. Tall capped ones spring from the ground acting like trees. In the shades are smaller, vabriantly colored fungi hanging from here and there.

## Slanty
A crumbling stone tower rises out of the swamp, leaning at such an angle that it threatens to keel over. Black brambles surround the base of the tower and cling to its lower half. Hanging off the roof on the lower side of the tower's peak is a large woven basket at the end of a tangle of ropes and tattered fabric. The basket dangles thirty feet above the surface of the swamp.

(Yanaba and anyone else with higher then 15 passive perception)
You hear a soft murmuring coming from the basket above though you can not see the source.

(If the party yells)
"Oh.. oh hello? Is there someone down there? I seem to have found myself in a rather unfavorable way.."
(Wait a moment)
The top most window that the basket dangels beside quickly opens up with a *slam*. An abnormal arm reaches out and grabs at the contents inside the basket. "OH GOD! PLEASE HELP ME". The arm retracts with a bird cage.. housed within is a small dragon like creature. The window shuts a moment later.

(If Elmer knows about the party)
If the party are charging his home, he will meet them on the stairs of the second and third floor and in Sylvan as for them to stop. Notably he does leave the cage upstairs.
    (If the players continue their assault) He and the Alpha attack
    (If the players stop their attack Elmer relaxes) [SYLVAN] What can Elmer help you with..

        - he has no magical items
        - no money

    - Personal/DnD/Witchlight/rp-prompts.md

5. A path disturbed
    - While walking the path towards Jingle Jangle' mountain the party will run into a tribe of primative Grungs. The Grungs will wait until the party moves further down the path and then ambush them when they get to the middle.
    - The Grungs aren't by nature vicious and instead let their poison immobilize their foes so that they can take what they want from them.
        - If beaten, the party will lose their bags and small arms
        - If they beat a few of the Grungs, then the entire tribe will scatter into the bushes.
        - The encounter should be more of a "run away" moment, then a stand and fight as the Grungs will have a great deal more in numbers.
    - The Grungs have an effigy to the Slackjaw Monster
        - "A large effigy of some strange god is erected using Mud, Sticks, Twine and Bones in the center of the creature make-shift camp. Smaller versions of the same thing are strung in trees and off rocks as well.
    - They worship the Slackjaw Monster, the transformed version of Slackjaw Lorna believing it to have birthed them in this place. They rob what they can of the players is given the opportunity. They will become somewhat hostile and will attack, however don't really seek to kill and will retreat if they themselves begin losing. 

6. A foot beneath the mountain
    - The mountain stands on 4 massive feet. The party will first need to figure out how they plan on getting up. Jingle Jangle has a ladder on a spring to get down, and to get up she tickles in-between one of the feet' toes to have it giggle thus alerting one of the shrublings to come help her
    - The mountain though full of green life is all but empty otherwise. A hut can be found but that to has been abandon. Schematics can be found within (DC 18 investigation check).
        - Jingle Jangle is out collecting Boom Schrooms in the swamp
    
    - Once the players have been there for awhile, and assuming they haven't destroyed anything, the trees begin to whisper in Sylvan to them.
        - "(Whispy voices fill the air) Who are you? What do you want?"
    - If the players become destructive then the trees will instead angry deman in Sylvan:
        - "(Whispy angry voices fill the air) LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME."

7. This way something comes
    - Run this at the end of the session
"From off in the distance, deep in the woods, you begin to hear something. At first it's an instinct as 100s of subtle vibrations run up your legs, your brain picking up on the minute detail. Then it becomes auditory, thump thump thump thump thump, quick and rythmic, like a giant centipede moving across the land.. and towards you. You move away but it persists and only gets closer.. and that is where we will end tonights session"

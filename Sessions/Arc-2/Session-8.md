# Beats
(Each character needs 3 challenges to overcome)

- Yanaba
    - Down the rabbit hole
        - Yanaba wakes up with her hands tied behind her back, seated on some old wooden boxes. The smell of dust and old wood permeates the air around her. As she shifts slightly a tang of pain shoots up her leg, without looking she knows there is an arrow sized hole barely closed somewhere below her knee.

        - As she looks up she sees another Herrigon, fur as white as snow and a cracked black nose. His blue eyes like that of saphires stare at her and around his neck is a scarf of equal blue. 

        - Aaragon will begin questioning her in the following order. He won't be willing to give away any information. If Yanaba attempts to lie it's a deception vs insight check
            - "Who are you, what's your name?"
            - "I know every Herrigon in The Burrows and you aren't one of them which means you must be from High tree. How'd you get here?"
            - "Do you realize what you and your friends have done here? Speaking of, your friends, how does a Herrigon come about such company?"
            - "About a week ago you killed my lieutenant, her name was Jabel, do you remember her?"
                - "She was a good woman.. her husband whom you've met has been pushing to arm our small gang for the last while, and her death.. well I'm sure you can feel the ramifications of that decision" *he motions down to your leg
                - "Your choice to kill Jabel pushed my gang ever closer to becoming dangerous.. That in turn has put a larger mark on mine and their backs, whether they know it or not"
            - Up until now I provided Herrigon of the Burrows with a means of escaping their meager lives. Thanks to you and your friends, they instead.. Well never mind now I suppose.
                - (If pressed) They will become food for The Great Horned Frog.
        
        - Provide a moment for Yanaba to question Aaragon if she wishes

    - With a mighty boom
        - KABOOM! KABOOM! The sound of two massive explosions cause Aaragon to wince and you to shrink in your seat. "What the hell was that!" Aaragon jumping to his feet, his long scarf flowing live a river around him. KABOOM! Dust, cleaved from the walls, falls all around the dark room like rain. 

        - Aaragon begins to move towards a door before pausing. "If you don't believe me go to The Burrows yourself. Unfortunately I can't have you causing anymore damage." Aaragon spins on his heel and with the flick of his wrist launches a strange stone at you. As it hits you another KABOOM ricochets through the air. Gravity fails you and you begin to twist as the stone pulls you towards it with rapid effeciency.

        - With a thump you land on the hard packed ground of a small well lit room about 15 feet by 15 feet. The bindings that held you have disappeared.. and as you stand you hear a distint "Hmmph" from behind you. You are faced with two strange doors, both of which have old wooden faces.. and they seem to be looking at you. 

        - The left door says "Well grumpy I believe we have a new guest", The right door responds "I may be grumpy but at least I don't creak when I open"

        - The doors are nameless and when asked pose a riddle to Yanaba. 
            - Escape is not easy, escape is not quick, to get through you'll have to use your wit. Which of us is a liar?
            - The trick is that they both are liars

    - On her way out
        - You reappear where the stone hit you, on the ground beneath your feet is the stone and the rope that was used to bind you. Looking around you recognize the possesions of your friends stacked on various counters.
            - She can't carry it all, weight will come in to play here.
            - Additionally there is a hooded lantern of revealing

        - As Yanaba leaves she will get a quick glimpse of a small war going on between Jingle Jangle and the Herrigon
            - Aaragon: ".. think it's fine to bomb my house? Are you insane.. why am I asking of course you are"
            - Jingle Jangle: "YOU PROMISED TO GIVE ME THE KEYS YOU FIND AARAGON!"
            - Aaragon: "You're a psychopath Jingle Jangle. We don't have your bloody key.
            - Jingle Jangle: "YOU DO HAVE IT YOU LIAR"
            - Aaragon: "Want to come in and search for it then?"
            - Jingle Jangle: "YES I DO"

        - During this exchange, if Sevro is still with her, Yanaba will see him and Jewels.

- Nuff & Baraka
    - The fight pits
        - Grundel wasn't able to convince Aaragon to let him toy with and kill all of their captured enemies as sacrifices need to be sent to Downfall as tribute, however, he was able to convince Aaragon to give him Nuff and Baraka who look like good sport. 

        - As your bruised and swollen eyes open you're met with a fuzzy hand tilting your head back and pinching your lips. The herrigon holds a strange purple flower and from it a foul tasting goop leaks out and into your mouths. Though you try and resist, your bodies instinctively gulp it down, if only to ease the pains caused your dust filled throats. From somewhere above you a gravely voice fills the air, though what it says is unknown to you.

        - Nuff and Baraka until the end of combat have the following free action:
            - Blood rush, take 1d4 damage receive and extra action for the round
        
        Round 1, the two will face two short sword Herrigon with their bare hands
        Round 2, the two will face the flail snail who will flee and hide in his shell after taking 10 damage
        Round 3, the two will Grundy who jumps down from his elevated podium and engages the two with his spear


- Sevro
    - From begin two thick red skinned hands covered in matted black fur grab you, a gutteral "RAWGWGGGGW" erupting from behind you. (Let Travis react)
    
    - The creature is Graaumpphhaaa the bugbear (Ettin) and though he is acting aggressive, it's only half hearted.

    - Soon after attacking Sevro a woman's voice springs up from nearby "Graaumpphhaaa, what have you got over there? Are you attacking our guest?"
        - Graaumpphhaaa is in love with Jingle Jangle but being a half braindead creature has no way of expressing it.
        - Graaumpphhaaa will immediately lose interest in Sevro
        - Jingle Jangle: "Oh.. You aren't are guest.. well I suppose you're a new guest then?.. Hello"
        - From nearby Sevro will hear a familiar voice: "Sorry love, I was just relieving myself, what did I miss" and from out behind a tree Jewels will appear
    
    - Jingle Jangle
        - Is curious to who Sevro is and how he got here
        - Is preparing for her attack and will ask him to come with her to her house so she can continue to work while they speak
    
    - Jewels
        - Truly won't recognize Sevro
        - Will refuse to believe that "this donkey" could be his good friend Sevro

    - If Sevro follows Jingle Jangle to her house he will see he preparing the last knock knock sticks
        - If asked what she is doing: "I'm going to pay a dirty, filthy liar a visit.. and blow his doors in for stealing from me!"
            - Though Aaragon did find it, he has since given it to away to the Herrigon currently carting Di and Karag to be delivered to Downfall
        - "Want to come with me? I could always use another.. hoof"



- Di & Karag
    - From the kettle
        - The wooden cage comes to a halt, the two Herrigon whom had been guiding the Giant Snails that were a moment ago pulling the cart turning back and yelling something you don't understand to unknown visages around you. Each of your heads hurt something fierce, the sound of blood rushing through the veins in your heads like rushing torrents threatening pain at any provocation. You've both been stripped of your possesions, though graciously it seems that you weren't bound up and canaried, only the latter. Off in the distance, the old church peek can be seen, it seems that the Herrigon haven't got the two of you very far as of yet.

        - The lead Herrigon undo the snails whom begin to crawl their way to nearby bushes and begin to eat. The handful of Herrigon around you speak briefly in hushes tones before moving off in small groups and setting up a makeshift camp around the cage.


        - The two of them should be given time to speak and think of what they could do
    
    - Into boiling water
        - A few hours seem to pass. (Have them roll perception checks) X as you're studying the ground you notice something.. the ground seems to be getting wet.. like very wet and very quickly. 

        - It's not long after you realize this that the Herrigon seem to notice as well.. The Herrigon begin to run around rapidly chirping at eachother. One points in the cages direction before another seems to snap back. The group of Herrigon then scramble away leaving the cage behind.
        

        - Karag and Di need a way out and fast as the water begins to rise quickly towards where they are. 
            - They have 10 rounds before they are submerged
            - If they try and break the cage and critically miss, they instead topple the cage over and put that timer to 6


    - And put on the flame
        - Assuming they head back to the old ruined church:

        - Di will be greeted by precious metal nodes and a large ruby that are begging to be excavated
        - Karag will commune with Grumbar
            - Grumbar will offer him "The teachings of stone"
                - Those of Grumbar needs to remember the teachings of Primal Earth:
                    1. The surface is still regardless of how in motion the things beneath are
                    2. When faced with high winds and fast waters, stone stands strong and proud
                    3. The only path forward is your own
                - After leaving the church, Lorna in her beast form will attack
                    - Tempest will attempt distract Di
                    - Lorna will bite Karag and further curse him

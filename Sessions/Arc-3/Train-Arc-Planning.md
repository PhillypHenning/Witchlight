# Summary
Clobberclaw still needs his head back from the Blue Scarf Gangs hideout, however Clobberclaw is secretly a double agent, who is working to gain the Hourglass Covens favor back. 

After Clobberclaw gets his head back he will bring the party into the mists at the edge of Hither and lead them to a train that connects the 4 pieces of the broken Prismeer. The train is a sleep demon, once the players enter they will fall asleep and the sleep demon will begin digesting them. The mechanics of this is that the party will be trapped in a extremely dangerous train. If any one of them die that player loses 10 max health and they all wake up back at the beginning. If a player is reduced to 0 max health they die. 

# Areas
## Train Cars:

1. **Engine Car:**
   - **Phantom Engineer:** A spectral figure endlessly shoveling coal into a blazing furnace. It’s a mirage; interacting with it causes nearby flames to surge, dealing fire damage.
   - **Choking Smoke:** The room fills with thick smoke. Players must pass a Constitution saving throw or begin suffocating, reducing movement speed until they exit the car or dispel the smoke.

2. **Dining Car:**
   - **Mimic Feast:** The food and furniture in this car are mimics. They attack any who touch them, and the entire room shifts to disorientate the party, providing cover for the mimics' attacks.
   - **Endless Feast Illusion:** A beguiling tableau of delicious food that charms players into wasting time ‘eating’, creating a risk of being consumed by the demon if not snapped out of it.

3. **Passenger Car:**
    - **Dreams of the Lost:** Ghostly figures from the players’ pasts appear, pleading for help. Interaction risks a charm effect, tethering the player to the spot in an endless cycle of interaction.
    - **Mirror Doppelgangers:** Reflections of the players step out of mirrors and challenge them, copying their stats and abilities.
    
    - **Whispering Gossip:**
    - **Judgmental Phantoms:** Ghostly passengers whisper secrets and falsehoods about the party members. If players listen closely, they must make Wisdom saving throws or suffer disadvantage on attacks and perception checks due to self-doubt and distraction.

    - **Illusory Reunion:**
    - **Comforting Illusion:** Each player sees someone they care about, offering them rest and safety. This is an illusion meant to drain their will to fight; players must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw each round or fall into a deep, magic-induced slumber.

    - **The Marionette Show:**
    - **Puppet Masters:** Strings descend from the ceiling, making players the marionettes in a twisted puppet show. Players must succeed on Strength or Dexterity saves to avoid being controlled, causing their actions to be turned against their allies during the fight.

    - **Shifting Seats:**
    - **Musical Chairs:** Whenever the players enter this car, the seats rearrange, dividing the players across the room. Whenever the lights flicker, seating changes happen and forgotten items or players may disappear temporarily only to reappear elsewhere in the train later, changing the dynamics of combat and puzzle-solving.

    - **Dance of Nightfall:**
    - **Enchanted Ballroom:** Illusory dancers fill the car, inviting players to join their eternal waltz. Those who refuse must contend with becoming the target of ghostly dancer attacks, while those who accept, risk dancing until exhaustion unless freed by an ally.

    - **Memory Lane:**
    - **Personal History Murals:** The walls in this car depict important events from each player’s life. They can interact with these images, learning truths or falsehoods that answer critical personal questions—or they can become lost in contemplation, suffering psychic damage or emotional penalties.

    - **Dream Decay:**
    - **Crumbling Reality:** Parts of the carriage flicker between glitchy, deteriorated states and their normal forms. Players must navigate these fragments carefully, lest they step onto an unstable floor and plunge into void-like traps, suffering high amounts of fall damage.

    - **Hall of Mirrors:**
    - **Reflective Maze:** The car is filled with reflective surfaces and doppelganger illusions, requiring players to differentiate between truth and illusory paths to progress. Each wrong turn could result in psychological strain or traps that lead to existential battles with their mirrored counterparts.

4. **Freight Car:**
   - **Crate of Nightmares:** Opening crates reveals nightmarish creatures (e.g., Shadow Monks or Dream Eaters) that coalesce from each player’s fears.
   - **Falling Cargo Trap:** Shifting crates and barrels swing and topple down, requiring Dexterity saves to evade bludgeoning damage.

5. **Observatory Car:**
   - **Starry Void:** An illusory night sky with swirling stars. If players look too long, they risk being lost in a trance, their minds absorbed by the dream demon.
   - **Astrological Possessions:** Constellations come to life as ghostly entities (e.g., celestial beasts) that roam the car and attack intruders.

### Monsters:

1. **Snore Sprites:** Small, impish creatures that bring slumber with their touch. They can cast sleep spells and attempt to separate vulnerable members of the party.

2. **Lucid Nightmares:** Horrifying creatures drawn from the players' minds, these nightmarish beings can shape-shift into the fears of each player, using psychological and physical attacks.

3. **REM Rippers:** Ethereal shadow creatures that drain lifeforce. Successful hits cause the loss of maximum hp, giving players a glimpse into the stakes of dying on the train.

4. **Conductor Wraith:** The personification of the train demon, this creature moves between train cars and teleports the party to random carriages if not stopped.

5. **Hypnos Elementals:** Manifestations of dream-like fog that confuse and split the party, disabling coordination with illusionary effects.

## Escape Mechanism:

As the party traverses these cars, they can gather pieces of a dream key—a metaphysical construct they must assemble to unlock the control the demon has over the dreams. You could add riddles or symbolic tasks to acquire key fragments, forcing players to confront and overcome aspects of their subconscious fears or failures.

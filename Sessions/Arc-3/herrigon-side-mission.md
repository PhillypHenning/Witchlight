# What is the point of this side mission

# Intro Cutscene
**The Burrows**

*Faint amber light spills into the small tunnels, a reminder of the twilight outside of The Burrows. The hum of everyday life echoes through the warren, children’s laughter mingling with the gentle murmur of adult conversations. Unbeknownst to the townsfolk, three sets of tiny paws have taken it upon themselves to embark on an adventure.*

**The Open Road**

*The scene shifts to a dusty road, a rickety wagon laden with loose produce trundling its way through the fading light. Within the crates and barrels, three young Herringon—eyes wide with wonder and mischief—cling to their secret. Whispered giggles and suppressed excitement accompany the creaking of wooden wheels.*

**Aagron’s Camp**

*An imposing camp emerges from the twilight. Torches flicker, casting shadows that dance across the encampment. Aagron Blue Scarf, the notorious yet unexpectedly kind-hearted leader of the Blue Scarf Gang, stands in the center, discussing plans with his men.*

**Discovery**

*The high-pitched squeal erupts as a curious camp hand yanks back the tarp, revealing the wide-eyed trio. The discovery sends ripples through the camp, all eyes turning towards the intruders. Heavy footsteps, the unmistakable thud of Grundy’s approach atop his flail snail, precede the burly second-in-command's irritated voice.*

**Grundy & Aagron**

*"What do we have here? A bunch of little troublemakers," Grundy grumbles, his deep voice like gravel. The children, shivering under his stern gaze, are corralled and led to Aagron.*

*Aagron, with his signature blue scarf fluttering in the breeze, looks down at the young Herringon. Though his face remains stern, a flicker of nostalgia softens his features. He sees reflections of his own past mischief in their fearful eyes.*

*"<Name>, you and your crew are to return them to The Burrows," Aagron orders, his voice decisive. "They don't belong here, especially with the recent dangers."*

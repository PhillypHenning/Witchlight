    - Bavlorna is out of town at the beginning of the adventure
    - Uthwyrm is frozen in time within The Witches Hut

    - One of Lorna's sisters minions are currently attempting to break into the vault
        - Lorna is on her way home to deal with this as the players enter the hut
    - The house is full of lornalings, no where is safe within

    ## Lorna
    - Would Lorna want anything from them?
        - Like all Witches, Lorna is covetous and selfish. She wants to see her two sisters perish, however she appreciates the power of the coven. In otherwords, she doesn't want to see any of her sisters die.
        - Skabatha stole two magical items from her not so long ago that she would love to have them back   
            - Jar of Frogs
            - The Twining Ring
    - When she gets home what happens?
        - She would transform back into her witch self
        - Knowing that Moonlight has agents currently trying to break into her house she was already coming back with killing intent
        - She enters into the hut and the following happens:
            1. All the doors and windows suddenly slam shut, a deep darkness cluthes the halls of the hut
            2. Lorna's voice rings out "So many options for me to choose from. Who shall I eat first, my sister's agents, or the strangers who has broken in while I was away.." 
            3. The Lornalings will then begin running in and around the hut creating noise and tension
            4. Lorna wants to play with her food, delighting in the dread she causes. She will prioritize hurting as many of the intruders as possible.
    - How will Lorna interact with Karag?
        - All saving throws that Karag has to do against the Witch will be at disadvantage
        - Lorna's dominate person when used successfully against Karag will activate his rage and set his allies to enemies

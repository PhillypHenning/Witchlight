    - In the previous session, during the night, Karag had an awful nightmare
    - Read Karag's Nightmare

1. Inn at the end of the road
    - Fritz the otter is enjoying dinner as the group walks in
        - Fritz intends to stay at the inn seeing as the players weren't able to save his library
    - Quicksilver is on his way out
        - If the players ask he will tell them honestly of his intentions to return to The Forests of Hither
            - If persuaded he may even tell them about the mountain like an upside down question mark that he uses to find his way back.
    - Marunu remains waiting for Tempest
    - Tempest will enter the inn a short while after the party and him and Marunu will leave together shortly after that

2. Sevro's lineup
    - When
        - If the party sleeps at the Inn, they will be awoken by the sounds of trumpets blaring outside the inn. 
        - If the party leaves this will occur next time they rest
    - A lineup of 6 knights stands in an orderly fashion a few feet away from the inn's entrance
        - Before long the various knight's squires will begin to announce their honory and will state their place in line to kill King Sevro

3. Where to next?
    - [QUEST] Clobberclaw wants his preferred head back. The head was stolen by the Bluescarf gang and resides in their Stump hideout
    - [OPTIONAL_EXIT] Leave Thither via Quicksilver's mention
        - They will need access to some airborne vehicle
            - Balloon being the obvious choice
    - [LOCATION] The Burrows still remains unvisited
    - [ENTITY] Chopain will be uninterested in helping them as he is busy with other work and doesn't have the time

## Karag's Nightmare
As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you find yourself seated at the head of a long, ancient dining table, the wood scarred and stained with time. The room around you feels claustrophobic, the oppressive weight of lingering shadows pressing in from all directions. You sense watching eyes, though you cannot see them. 

To your right, a thickly muscled half-orc sits with reckless abandonment. His every action is a cacophony of noise — he spits onto the floor, chuckles with a guttural, mocking laugh, and lets out a thunderous belch that reverberates through the chamber. His presence is overwhelming, a crude force of nature that seems to revel in the chaos he creates.

Directly across the table from him sits another orc, a stoic contrast to the barbarian's unruliness. This orc is the picture of calmness, his form shrouded in stillness, eyes patiently locked onto the barbaric figure as if trying to decipher an enigma or await the culmination of an inevitable conflict.

From the darkness behind you, you feel the brush of something against your shoulder, sending a shiver down your spine. Instinctively, you turn your head just in time to see a slender arm, its skin a sickly, mottled green, extending into the dim light. It's Bavlorna, the Frog Witch, her presence a sinister veil blanketing the room. In her hand, she holds a platter, the contents obscured by shadow but clear in their promise of doom or salvation.

Her voice, a rasping whisper that curls around your thoughts, instructs, "Choose one." It's as much command as it is invitation, a dark thread pulling at the very fibers of your being.

- **If you decide to feed the barbaric orc**, you watch as he devours the offering voraciously. A satisfied grin splits his face, but your relief is short-lived. Across the table, the stoic orc begins to fade, his form disintegrating into lifeless dust, leaving behind an echoing silence.

- **Refusing the barbaric orc**, As the plate comes to rest infront of the stoic orc his foil unleashes his unrestrained fury. The barbaric orc lunges over the table with savage intent. His hands wrapping around the stoic orc's throat before he can even fully comprehend the situation.

- **Should you choose to feed neither**, you sense a shift. Bavlorna’s arm retreats slowly, the shadows whispering in conspiracies. Both orcs lock eyes with you one final time before they simultaneously crumble into dust, leaving you alone in the silence, with only the cold stare of your reflection in Bavlorna’s eyes lingering in the darkness.

- **Feeding both**, against the odds, results in a pause. They remain, as does the oppressive tone of the room, the spell holding firm, keeping you trapped in this eternal tableau without change — a haunting reminder of the decisions left unmade.

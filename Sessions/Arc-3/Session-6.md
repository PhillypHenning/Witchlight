    - [PLANNED] Karag's dream
        - Karag nods off for just a moment, as he opens his eyes he is sat at the head of a long dark table that stretches away into the distance. Infront of him are two shadowy figures, one sits still and silently staring down at an empty plate disconnected. The other is barely contained by his seat, rocking back and forth, slamming his fork and knife into the table and hollaring
        - Bavlornas voice and hand will slink out from the darkness
            - "Come now Karag, don't be a bad host." A plate with a full chicken appears beside him, "Go on now, feed one of them! They look starving"
        - The choice
            - Karag's choice matters in this scneario
                1. He feeds the silent figure, the angry one loses it jumping across the table and attacking him before he can finish
                2. He feeds the angry figure, the solemn one looks on without saying a word, slowly his armor begins to rust and the skin falls from his bones leaving a skeleton hunched forward and watching
                3. He feeds both of them, the Witch retreats silently into the dark
                4. He feeds neither, Lorna laughs as both of them turn into skeletons and then dust
- Di

        - [PLANNED] Chopain will give Di a fancy new +1 weapon and tell him to keep it on him at all times. The sword is hexed to allow Chopain to Scry Di. The Hourglass Coven has put a hex on Prismeer to severly limits scrying within their domain.
    
- Yanaba
    - [PLANNED] Yanaba runs into.. Yanaba
        - There are very few rules in the universe, one of them is "All Yanabas find the TimeStone amulet on their 12th birthday, which leads to the death of her parents and the subsequent leaving to face the evils of the world as an adventurer."
        - Yanaba 1 got to the end of her journey and during the fight with the Hourglass Coven.. lost everyone. Guilt ridden and angry Yanaba makes a universe changing decision.. she time hops to another timeline to save her friends, unfortunately for her she jumps into a timeline in which that Yanaba, Yanaba 2, is the apprentice to The Hourglass Coven!
        - The evil Yanaba seeing a potential threat to her and her plans takes action which begins a mad dash through time as Yanaba 1 and Yanaba 2 begin to war with each other that ever escalates.
        - In the latest jump Yanaba 1 has landed on our Yanaba's timeline and it just so happens that this Yanaba is the only Yanaba in all timelines who never got the TimeStone amulet. While the two are speaking they are ambushed by Yanaba 2's henchmen (more Yanabas) and during the fight Yanaba 1 is gravely injured. In her last moments she passes our Yanaba her amulet and asks her to make sure she keeps them all safe before dying.

        5. **Scroll of Entangle (1st Level):** Harness the power of nature to hold enemies in place with grasping vines and roots, reflecting the wild and unpredictable nature of fey magic.
        6. [Investigation_15] **Scroll of Invisibility (2nd Level):** Unseen movement can add an element of stealth reminiscent of the elusive fey, who often disappear from sight with ease.
        7. [Investigation_20] **Scroll of Moonbeam (2nd Level):** Channeling the ethereal light of the moon, this radiant spell is perfect for a night under the fey starlit skies.
        8. [Investigation_20] **Scroll of Counterspell (3rd Level):** This scroll represents the capstone of the collection, allowing the caster to unravel magical effects, much like the unpredictable twists of fey interference.

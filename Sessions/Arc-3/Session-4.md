# Event
## Lorna returns home
### Horror Event: Bavlorna's Return 

**Setting the Scene:**
The atmosphere is tense as Bavlorna returns to her cottage, unaware of the intruders. The Lornalings (invisible as always) have alerted her to the presence of three parties within her home, and she’s none too pleased. She intends to terrify them before dealing with them directly. 

**Event Flow:**

#### Phase 1: Lockdown
As Bavlorna approaches, describe a sudden and intense change in the environment. 
- **Sound Effects:** Begin with an eerie silence that is suddenly shattered by the loud banging and slamming of doors and windows. Each door and window in the house slams shut and locks, trapping everyone inside.
- **Visual Effects:** Light sources flicker and dim, casting long, wavering shadows around the room.

**Rolls:**
1. **Perception or Insight Check (DC 15):** Detect the presence of the Lornalings moving invisibly around the space.
    - Success: They discern the faint hints of invisible creatures scuttling around, causing the noises.

#### Phase 2: Lornaling Mischief 
The invisible Lornalings begin to create minor but disturbing effects.
- **Flickering Lights:** Light sources flicker, casting sinister shadows.
- **Whispering Voices**: Soft whispers in an unintelligible language fill the rooms, seeming to come from the walls themselves.
- **Sudden Cold Drafts:** Out of nowhere, a cold breeze sweeps through, lowering the temperature notably. 

**Rolls:**
1. **Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 12):** To avoid minor Fear effects.
   - Failure: The character feels an inexplicable dread, granting them disadvantage on their next ability check.
2. **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 12):** Throw random potion
    -  2d4 acid / fire / freeze damage (pick one)
3. **Strength Saving Throw (DC 12):** To avoid being toppled over and thrown to the ground
    - Failure: The creature is toppled to the ground.

#### Phase 3: Sol’s Panic and Gloam’s Despair
Sol, one of Endelyn's henchmen, begins to panic, heightening the tension. He attempts to force open a window, while Gloam falls to her knees in abject terror.

#### Phase 4: Bavlorna's Entrance
Bavlorna dramatically enters, enhancing the fear. Use descriptive language to paint her entrance vividly.
- **Entering Scene:** The front door creaks open with a slow, drawn-out groan. Bavlorna steps in, her pale, warty skin glistening with moisture. Her eyes gleam in the dim light, reflecting an eerie glow.

**Rolls:**
1. **Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 15):** Against a Fear effect from Bavlorna’s terrifying appearance.
    - Failure: The character is frightened for 1 minute, unable to move closer to Bavlorna.

#### Phase 5: Confrontation
Bavlorna addresses the intruders, her voice dripping with malice.
- **Dialogue:** “Trespassers in my domain… how brave of you, or perhaps foolish?”

**Rolls:**
1. **Charisma Saving Throw (DC 18):** Bavlorna intimidates the characters giving them disadvantage on any actions that would harm her for the rest of the encounter.

#### Phase 6: Potential Combat or Escape
Depending on the party's actions, they might need to fight, negotiate, or find a way to escape. Here are details for possible actions:
   
**Combat Rolls:**
1. **Roll Initiative:** If combat begins, roll initiative for all parties involved.
2. **Combat Actions:** Use Bavlorna's stats and those of her Lornalings for combat.

**Escape Rolls:**
1. **Investigation Check (DC 15):** To find a vulnerable exit point.
2. **Strength or Dexterity Check (DC 17):** To break open or bypass the locking mechanism.
   
**Social Interaction Rolls:**
1. **Insight Check (DC 12):** To gauge Bavlorna’s mood or intentions.
2. **Persuasion Check (DC 15):** To plead for mercy or strike a deal.

### Additional Details:  
- **Atmospheric Descriptions:**
  - **Smell:** A foul, swampy odor fills the cottage.
  - **Ambient Sounds:** Creaking floorboards, the occasional splash of water, distant croaks of unseen frogs.

### Ending the Scenario
Depending on player choices, Bavlorna’s reaction and the final outcome can vary:
- **Negotiation/Deal:** Bavlorna can offer the players a task or exchange to let them leave unharmed.
- **Fight:** If combat ensues, be prepared for an intense battle with her and the Lornalings.
- **Escape:** Clever characters might find a way out through brute force or magical means.

By successfully integrating these elements, you’ll create a memorable, spine-chilling experience for your players in Bavlorna’s cottage.

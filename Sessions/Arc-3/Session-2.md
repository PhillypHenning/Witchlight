# Recap


# Session beats
## Saving The Watcher
    - Currently she is muzzled by black leather and chains that stretch onto a cliff that stands 20 feet up.

    - The Watcher doesn't understand her ability, she simply knows everything. Her powerful ability has the caveat that she can only do it once for people, including herself.
    - She was captured by Cho Pain's goons, she is lucky that the party stumbled upon her when they did.
    - When saved she offers her services to them

## Kawai the mermaid
    - A merman with short blue hair and a musclar upper physique swims into the mouth of the cave.  
        - "I thought I heard a noise. Watcher, I'm surprised to find you here."
    - Kawai is Rain's brother
    - Kawai might know a way to help Rain if alerted to her predicament, however he will need help himself. Kawai is in the area because he was expecting a message from the Mayor of The Burrows.. he's been here only a day but that's still strange for the Herrigon who are usually always quick. He is willing to go see about a solution but he requests that the party go check in on The Burrows

## Where the road takes us
As they travel through the swamp 2 displacer beasts will pick up on their scent and begin tracking them. Three party members make a survival check they need: 12, 13, 14. If any of them make the check they are not caught surprised in the ambush.

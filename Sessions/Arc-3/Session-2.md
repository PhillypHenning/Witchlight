# Recap


# Session beats
## Saving The Watcher
    - Currently she is muzzled by black leather and chains that stretch onto a cliff that stands 20 feet up.

    - The Watcher doesn't understand her ability, she simply knows everything. Her powerful ability has the caveat that she can only do it once for people, including herself.
    - She was captured by Cho Pain's goons, she is lucky that the party stumbled upon her when they did.
    - When saved she offers her services to them

## Kawai the mermaid
    - A merman with short blue hair and a musclar upper physique swims into the mouth of the cave.  
        - "I thought I heard a noise. Watcher, I'm surprised to find you here."
    - Kawai is Rain's brother
    - Kawai might know a way to help Rain if alerted to her predicament, however he will need help himself. Kawai is in the area because he was expecting a message from the Mayor of The Burrows.. he's been here only a day but that's still strange for the Herrigon who are usually always quick. He is willing to go see about a solution but he requests that the party go check in on The Burrows

## Where the road takes us
As they travel through the swamp 2 displacer beasts will pick up on their scent and begin tracking them. Three party members make a survival check they need: 12, 13, 14. If any of them make the check they are not caught surprised in the ambush.

# Notes

- Di climbs up The Watcher

- The Watcher
    - Di was the first ask where Zalbina is
    - Yanaba asked about where the unicorns wife is
    - Sevro asked for a weapon and instead got a warning
    - Karag asked for Burly




In shadows deep and witches' weave,
Zalbina's fate, a tale to grieve.
Bound in dimension, lost to time,
Three witches' curse, a darkened crime.

In dreams entwined, the unicorn's plea,
Her mate transformed tragically.
A rocking chair, a wooden guise,
By Skabatha's craft, hidden from eyes.

Burly's form, now mortal guise,In Thither's land, confusion lies.A twisted mind by Skabatha's art,Forgotten past, a fractured heart.

In verdant swamps where shadows creep,
Deep sorrow lies, a secret deep.
Bavlorna reigns, with eyes of spite,
In guise of frog, she claims the night.

Your parents' breath, in darkness stilled,
By nature's cruel, their fate was sealed.
Her horned form, a terror vast,
In death's embrace, their lives did pass.





Sevro has entered into an agreement where Chopain has transformed him into Darrow. In return Chopain gets to ask Sevro for a request that must be fulfilled in 1 week or his soul is Chopain.

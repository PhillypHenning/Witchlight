        - Karag nods off for just a moment, as he opens his eyes he is sat at the head of a long dark table that stretches away into the distance. Infront of him are two shadowy figures, one sits still and silently staring down at an empty plate disconnected. The other is barely contained by his seat, rocking back and forth, slamming his fork and knife into the table and hollaring
        - Bavlornas voice and hand will slink out from the darkness
            - "Come now Karag, don't be a bad host." A plate with a full chicken appears beside him, "Go on now, feed one of them! They look starving"
        - The choice
            - Karag's choice matters in this scneario

        - There are very few rules in the universe, one of them is "All Yanabas find the TimeStone amulet on their 12th birthday, which leads to the death of her parents and the subsequent leaving to face the evils of the world as an adventurer."
        - Yanaba 1 got to the end of her journey and during the fight with the Hourglass Coven.. lost everyone. Guilt ridden and angry Yanaba makes a universe changing decision.. she time hops to another timeline to save her friends, unfortunately for her she jumps into a timeline in which that Yanaba, Yanaba 2, is the apprentice to The Hourglass Coven!
        - The evil Yanaba seeing a potential threat to her and her plans takes action which begins a mad dash through time as Yanaba 1 and Yanaba 2 begin to war with each other that ever escalates.

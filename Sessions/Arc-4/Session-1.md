# DM Notes
- This happens over the course of 3 months.

# Into the fog
## Lost.
- Each player can keep up to 3 items that they can remember as well as their standard gear.

## Round and Round we go
1. Mist coils around your feet, a ghostly presence that clings to low-lying ferns and moss-covered stones. At the edge of the fog, you see fleeting silhouettes of creatures darting between the shadows, just beyond clear focus.

2. The air hangs heavy with humidity, and every breath seems thick with the rich, earthy smells of damp soil and decay. The fog swirls with unseen currents, echoing distant whispers that seem to beckon you deeper.

3. Sunlight dapples through the tree branches, casting a dance of light and shadow onto the forest floor. Between tendrils of fog, brief glimpses of vibrant foliage shimmer like mirages, tantalizing yet elusive.

4. Twisted branches of ancient trees stretch upwards, draped in long wisps of hanging moss that ripple slowly in an unfelt breeze. Beyond the fog, you catch fragments of laughter as though the forest is teasing secrets from the past.

5. A gentle brook meanders through the underbrush, its soothing babble playing a stark contrast to the swamp's stagnance. The fog hangs low above the water, and reflections within whisper of places both here and not.

6. Pools of dark, stagnant water dot the landscape, their surfaces surreptitiously disturbed by occasional ripples. At the water’s edge, the fog breaks in patterns, hinting at paths or roads leading nowhere.

7. The air is fresh and crisp, carrying the pleasant scent of pine and rich earth, invigorating with each breath. The fog lingers like an old memory, revealing flickers of forgotten paths looping back on themselves.

8. Gnarled roots weave across your path like the distorted fingers of some underworld creature reaching skywards. In the fog's depths, shapes warp and twist, suggesting massive forms standing sentinel over this liminal space.

9. Luminous fungi cling to decaying logs, their faint glow casting an unearthly luminescence onto the ground. Beyond the haze, shifting glows seem to mirror your movement, as if the forest observes and mimics.

10. A canopy of intertwined branches filters the dim light, casting a patchwork of shadows on the slick, muddy ground. At the fog's edge, outlines of grand arches and gateways form and dissolve into the mist.

11. Vibrant wildflowers peek out from patches of sunlight, their vivid colors a testament to the forest's vitality. Hints of color dance at the fog’s periphery, bleeding into the grey as if the fog absorbs their essence.

12. Fluttering leaves rustle almost silently, disturbed only by ghostly whispers of wind passing through the canopy. In the mist, tails of fog whip and coil around unseen figures, suggesting company that remains just out of sight.

## Personals
### Karag
- While out collecting rocks a strange insect catches your eye, describe what you see
- "As you get up you feel a flash of movement in the wood a short distance a way. It sounded like the falling thump, like a body landing from a jump. The awful sound of Balorna's laugh fills the air and your world blacks out."
    - Have everyone roll, the lowest roll wakes up to Karag breathing heavily standing over his bed. If disturbed he will attack. If the party leaves him without making to much noise, he will snap out of it.

### Terran
- As you're pulling your fishing gear out you hear a twig snap off in the woods. You turn and see Karag coming up behind you, fishing gear in hand. He's heading up river of you.
- Terran as you are setting up your sleeping spot you hear a large crash of pots and pans. You turn around the find Sevro quick scramping to pick up a now half buried campfire, the port smothering the fire to near death.

### Di
- [NOTE] Chopain is unreachable
- Everyone in the camp has left to get tonight's supplies, only yourself, Jewels and Clobberclaw remain

### Yanaba
- While walking you get the growing sense that something large and predatory is following right behind. A nearby twig snapping in the woods all but proves it. You whip around and see nothing but dense bush spanning off into the distance. You're heart is racing, your breath is shallow and quick in your chest. What do you do? 
    - It's Karag collecting some wood a short distance away.
- You're walking through the camp heading towards the wood pile Karag as collected. As you step around a small boulder hard set into the ground, you see Di sitting quietly, staring at the sword he seemed to have collected from the library wight.

### Sevro
- While at camp, preoccupied with something you're doing you're surprised to hear Di's voice calling you from somewhere out in the wood. You look around and see your compatriots, including Di, speaking a short distance away.
    - It's a frog that happens to sound exactly like Di sitting out in the fogs
- You hear a beautiful voice singing from where the basin on water is a short walk from the camp.
    - It's Jewels who's scrubbing his armpits


## NPCs
- Jewels
    - Hopes his sister found her way back to Tither as he believes he has exhausted his options in the swamps of Hither
    - Is impressed by Sevro's (Darrow's) escape but doesn't want to outright say anything
- Clobberclaw
    - Working for Endelyn
        - Is not willing to say his intentions other than as payment for finding his head
    - Plans on speaking to the Hourglass coven when he gets to Tither
    - Is willing to speak about the Hourglass Coven and their sons if asked. 

# End of Session
Another step. Another step. Another step. 

One more step and you'll have taken nearly a million steps. The monotony and boredom has well set in, at this point you've all become little more than machines. You walk until you can't, you sleep until you can, and then you do it again. The monotony is made worse as you travel over the same environments, over and over and over again.

Another step... than nothing. Your body doesn't move forward. Strange. You look down and you're mid stride, you look up and see your companion ahead is looking around confused as well. It takes a moment but you soon realize that for the first time in a million steps.. you're somewhere new. It's dark and oppressive.. it feels clustrophobic.. and no matter how bad that may be, it's different than the monotony and for that you feel.. relief?

Another step.. Another step.. The fog and shadows make way to rocky walls..
Another step.. Another step.. 

And we'll leave it there for tonight.

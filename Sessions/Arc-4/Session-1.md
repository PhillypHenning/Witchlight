# Into the fog
## Crash down

**They pick up right where we left off running into the fog.**


The camera sits level with the swampy ground as 3 sets of legs smash down into the muck and threw the frame. The camera jumps up and behind the runners. Karag, Terran and Jewels push every aching muscle in their body hard through the swamp towards the fog ahead of them. From far behind the sound of great beams of wood begin to swirl before an object of great weight is thrown into the air, the whooshing noise distinct and terror inducing. Above the 3 runners a balloon whips by, a flash of some dark magic pulses outward from within the casket and a Bullywog falls from it. The body of the creature hitting the tops of the trees and disappearing in a crash. Sevro's screaming can be heard ahead, but you lost track of him when the balloon passed overhead.

A massive explosion behind the runners nearly throws them to the ground as one of the boulders makes contact with the ground a few short feet behind them. And then another balloon passes overhead.

The two balloons seem to exchange arrow fire with each other as they pass into the fog. Half a minute later a thunderous crash, of objects hitting and trees splintering, is heard ahead. 

The runners hit the fog wall a short while after and find the two balloons from early entangeled and lifeless on the ground. As you three run up to it, Di explodes from beneath the fabrics, slung over one shoulder is Sevro and the other is Yanaba. The 4 of you run further into the fog.

You run. 
And run. 
And run some more.

Until finally in a foggy clearing you all drop of exhaustion. You don't have time to make camp. You don't have time to make a fire. Each of you collapse into a dishoveled pile beside another.

## Walking up

Clobberclaw has made a small fire nearby. He can't cook but wanted to make sure you all woke ready for the next leg of the journey.

Jewels is fast asleep using Darrow as a pillow

## Round and Round we go
1. Mist coils around your feet, a ghostly presence that clings to low-lying ferns and moss-covered stones. At the edge of the fog, you see fleeting silhouettes of creatures darting between the shadows, just beyond clear focus.

2. The air hangs heavy with humidity, and every breath seems thick with the rich, earthy smells of damp soil and decay. The fog swirls with unseen currents, echoing distant whispers that seem to beckon you deeper.

3. Sunlight dapples through the tree branches, casting a dance of light and shadow onto the forest floor. Between tendrils of fog, brief glimpses of vibrant foliage shimmer like mirages, tantalizing yet elusive.

4. Twisted branches of ancient trees stretch upwards, draped in long wisps of hanging moss that ripple slowly in an unfelt breeze. Beyond the fog, you catch fragments of laughter as though the forest is teasing secrets from the past.

5. A gentle brook meanders through the underbrush, its soothing babble playing a stark contrast to the swamp's stagnance. The fog hangs low above the water, and reflections within whisper of places both here and not.

6. Pools of dark, stagnant water dot the landscape, their surfaces surreptitiously disturbed by occasional ripples. At the water’s edge, the fog breaks in patterns, hinting at paths or roads leading nowhere.

7. The air is fresh and crisp, carrying the pleasant scent of pine and rich earth, invigorating with each breath. The fog lingers like an old memory, revealing flickers of forgotten paths looping back on themselves.

8. Gnarled roots weave across your path like the distorted fingers of some underworld creature reaching skywards. In the fog's depths, shapes warp and twist, suggesting massive forms standing sentinel over this liminal space.

---

9. Luminous fungi cling to decaying logs, their faint glow casting an unearthly luminescence onto the ground. Beyond the haze, shifting glows seem to mirror your movement, as if the forest observes and mimics.

10. A canopy of intertwined branches filters the dim light, casting a patchwork of shadows on the slick, muddy ground. At the fog's edge, outlines of grand arches and gateways form and dissolve into the mist.

11. Vibrant wildflowers peek out from patches of sunlight, their vivid colors a testament to the forest's vitality. Hints of color dance at the fog’s periphery, bleeding into the grey as if the fog absorbs their essence.

12. Fluttering leaves rustle almost silently, disturbed only by ghostly whispers of wind passing through the canopy. In the mist, tails of fog whip and coil around unseen figures, suggesting company that remains just out of sight.

## Personals
- While at camp, preoccupied with something you're doing you're surprised to hear Di's voice calling you from somewhere out in the wood. You look around and see your compatriots, including Di, speaking a short distance away.
    - It's a frog that happens to sound exactly like Di sitting out in the fogs
### Karag
- **Lost in Thought**: As Karag stumbles upon an ancient, weathered stone covered in strange runes, they find it disturbingly familiar. Allow them to describe what they see, and through their story, offer them clues—perhaps related to their lineage or ancestors—that could become critical in later decisions.

### Terran
- You find Di standing by a pool of water looking out in thought, what do you do
    - Di hears Terran leaving if he says nothing
- **Relic of the Past**: Terran's grief could be momentarily soothed—or agitated—by finding an object in the fog that belonged to a lost family member. This relic holds memories, compelling them to speak with their companions about revenge and justice.

### Di
- Everyone in the camp has left to get tonight's supplies, only yourself, Sevro and Clobberclaw remain
- **Moral Quandary**: The pact with a devil could manifest during a vivid waking dream: seeing themselves forging items of immense power but at what cost? As they snap out of the vision, they're holding a mundane item transformed into something sinister, hinting at future choices.

### Yanaba
- **Natural Instincts**: As a Haregon, their natural instincts might surge during the journey. The feeling of being stalked can heighten into a brief terror when a shadow in the fog reveals a shape Yanaba recalls from childhood—a fellow Haregon, seemingly lost to the mists and calling for help.

### Sevro
- **Reflection of Self**: With the transformation from human to donkey to elf, Sevro may find a moment to gaze into a mirror-like pool. In it, ask them what they see: their past self, the donkey, or the elf? The image speaks words in a language they recognize yet don't understand, hinting at keys to their future and true identity.
- You hear a beautiful voice singing from where the basin on water is a short walk from the camp.
    - It's Jewels who's scrubbing his armpits



## NPCs
- Jewels
    - Hopes his sister found her way back to Tither as he believes he has exhausted his options in the swamps of Hither
    - Is impressed by Sevro's (Darrow's) escape but doesn't want to outright say anything
        - Jewels will become Darrow's friend and will soon forget all about Sevro
- Clobberclaw
    - Working for Endelyn
        - Is not willing to say his intentions other than as payment for finding his head
    - Plans on speaking to the Hourglass coven when he gets to Tither
    - Is willing to speak about the Hourglass Coven and their sons if asked. 

# End of Session
Another step. Another step. Another step. 

One more step and you'll have taken nearly a million steps. The monotony and boredom has well set in, at this point you've all become little more than machines. You walk until you can't, you sleep until you can, and then you do it again. The monotony is made worse as you travel over the same environments, over and over and over again.

Another step... than nothing. Your body doesn't move forward. Strange. You look down and you're mid stride, you look up and see your companion ahead is looking around confused as well. It takes a moment but you soon realize that for the first time in a million steps.. you're somewhere new. It's dark and oppressive.. it feels clustrophobic.. and no matter how bad that may be, it's different than the monotony and for that you feel.. relief?

Another step.. Another step.. The fog and shadows make way to rocky walls..
Another step.. Another step.. 

And we'll leave it there for tonight.

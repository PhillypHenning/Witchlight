# Into the fog

## Crash down

**They pick up right where we left off running into the fog.**


The camera sits level with the swampy ground as 3 sets of legs smash down into the muck and threw the frame. The camera jumps up and behind the runners. Karag, Terran and Jewels push every aching muscle in their body hard through the swamp towards the fog ahead of them. From far behind the sound of great beams of wood begin to swirl before an object of great weight is thrown into the air, the whooshing noise distinct and terror inducing. Above the 3 runners a balloon whips by, a flash of some dark magic pulses outward from within the casket and a Bullywog falls from it. The body of the creature hitting the tops of the trees and disappearing in a crash. Sevro's screaming can be heard ahead, but you lost track of him when the balloon passed overhead.

A massive explosion behind the runners nearly throws them to the ground as one of the boulders makes contact with the ground a few short feet behind them. And then another balloon passes overhead.

The two balloons seem to exchange arrow fire with each other as they pass into the fog. Half a minute later a thunderous crash, of objects hitting and trees splintering, is heard ahead. 

The runners hit the fog wall a short while after and find the two balloons from early entangeled and lifeless on the ground. As you three run up to it, Di explodes from beneath the fabrics, slung over one shoulder is Sevro and the other is Yanaba. The 4 of you run further into the fog.

You run. 
And run. 
And run some more.

Until finally in a foggy clearing you all drop of exhaustion. You don't have time to make camp. You don't have time to make a fire. Each of you collapse into a dishoveled pile beside another.

## Walking up

Clobberclaw has made a small fire nearby. He can't cook but wanted to make sure you all woke ready for the next leg of the journey.

Jewels is fast asleep using Darrow as a pillow

## Round and Round we go
1. Mist coils around your feet, a ghostly presence that clings to low-lying ferns and moss-covered stones. At the edge of the fog, you see fleeting silhouettes of creatures darting between the shadows, just beyond clear focus.

2. The air hangs heavy with humidity, and every breath seems thick with the rich, earthy smells of damp soil and decay. The fog swirls with unseen currents, echoing distant whispers that seem to beckon you deeper.

3. Sunlight dapples through the tree branches, casting a dance of light and shadow onto the forest floor. Between tendrils of fog, brief glimpses of vibrant foliage shimmer like mirages, tantalizing yet elusive.

4. Twisted branches of ancient trees stretch upwards, draped in long wisps of hanging moss that ripple slowly in an unfelt breeze. Beyond the fog, you catch fragments of laughter as though the forest is teasing secrets from the past.

5. A gentle brook meanders through the underbrush, its soothing babble playing a stark contrast to the swamp's stagnance. The fog hangs low above the water, and reflections within whisper of places both here and not.

6. Pools of dark, stagnant water dot the landscape, their surfaces surreptitiously disturbed by occasional ripples. At the water’s edge, the fog breaks in patterns, hinting at paths or roads leading nowhere.

7. The air is fresh and crisp, carrying the pleasant scent of pine and rich earth, invigorating with each breath. The fog lingers like an old memory, revealing flickers of forgotten paths looping back on themselves.

8. Gnarled roots weave across your path like the distorted fingers of some underworld creature reaching skywards. In the fog's depths, shapes warp and twist, suggesting massive forms standing sentinel over this liminal space.

9. Luminous fungi cling to decaying logs, their faint glow casting an unearthly luminescence onto the ground. Beyond the haze, shifting glows seem to mirror your movement, as if the forest observes and mimics.

10. A canopy of intertwined branches filters the dim light, casting a patchwork of shadows on the slick, muddy ground. At the fog's edge, outlines of grand arches and gateways form and dissolve into the mist.

11. Vibrant wildflowers peek out from patches of sunlight, their vivid colors a testament to the forest's vitality. Hints of color dance at the fog’s periphery, bleeding into the grey as if the fog absorbs their essence.

12. Fluttering leaves rustle almost silently, disturbed only by ghostly whispers of wind passing through the canopy. In the mist, tails of fog whip and coil around unseen figures, suggesting company that remains just out of sight.

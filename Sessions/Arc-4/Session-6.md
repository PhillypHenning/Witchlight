# Recap

# Beats
1. Entrance to the twilight castle
    - A terrific cracking sound begins on the wall face. The rock wall begins to crack, a deep green light emanates outward. Large chunks of rock begin falling from the walls and beneath, a glowing set of double doors reveals itself.
    - On the door is the following two symbols:
        - A line with two half ocelating half-circles
        - A bontiful tree with roots
    - The door will open at the slightest push
2. Zil Vil Zon Toper (Amethyst Dragon)
    - Will come out from with the Kobolds
    - Though she is still wrapping her head around what has happened to her, she would like to offer the group a gift. A large purple scale. 
        - Zil Vil Zon Toper's scale
            - Can be used once to do one of the following
                - Call Zil Vil Zon Toper in to assist in combat for a single turn
                - Teleports the party to anywhere they wish
3. Entering the Twilight Court
    - 3 of the 7 doors remain intact, the rest are rusted and sealed close
    - The primary doors at one point may have had 7 seals
        - 4 of them are no longer visible
        - 1 is lit with the same tree as the door they entered in from
        - 2 are not
            - One seems to have a gear and wrench
            - One has a 2 headed dog and a whip
    - Finally, a strange off-shoot room seems almost fused into the wall, it reminds the group of an old shack long past its prime. In the center is a trap door.
        - Leads to the foundations where King Gloam barely holds on to life

# Combats
## Trap master Badda Ding
1. In the middle of a large room is a beartrap that's snapped shut. Whomever approaches it, the beartrap snaps open and 4 brown bears spawn and attack immediately

Once defeated, the bears seem to disapate and the beartrap in the middle again slowly closes.The room then suddenly turns completely blank. Nothing but white. No items. No doors. Nothing. 

2. The party needs to paint the walls with any color, once color paints the wall, the beartrap in the middle once again snaps open. 

Once the trick is figured out the bear trap closes once again. 

3. The bear trap needs to be set off once again, when done a "reverse bear" (werebear) appears.

After all this is complete, Badda ding with a small cane walks out laughing. His long white crazy hair seemingly exploding out of his head, ears and nose.

"That was good fun, I'm glad I could see fools fall for my inventions again. It's been a very long time." 

The goblin is friendly from here on out and is to old a frail to put up much of a fight. If he isn't asked he mentions that they group passes his test and he will turn his emblem on unlocking his portion of the door.

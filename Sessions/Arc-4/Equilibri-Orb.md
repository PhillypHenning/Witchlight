1. **Light and Shadow Manipulation:** (1/day)
   - **Twilight Veil:** The user can create a veil of twilight, creating a 30-foot-radius sphere of dim, silvery light that grants advantage on Stealth checks and disadvantage to creatures attempting Perception checks in the area. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.
   - **Glimmer of Dawn:** The orb can emit a brilliant flash of dawn-like light. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or be blinded for 1 minute. They can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns.

2. **Temporal Flux:** (1/week)
   - **Temporal Stasis:** Once per week, as an action, the orb can place a single creature in a state of suspended animation for up to one minute, during which they are immune to all damage and conditions. The creature is aware of its surroundings but cannot move or take actions. This effect can only be ended early by the user.

3. **Protection of the Twilight:** (1/day)
   - **Ward of Twilight:** Once per long rest, the orb can create a protective barrier that grants resistance to necrotic and radiant damage for 1 minute.

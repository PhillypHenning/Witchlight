### 5 Mundane Magical Items
1. [Karag] **Whispering Fern**: A small potted fern that quietly repeats any conversation held nearby within the last hour. Ideal for eavesdropping or remembering forgotten details.

2. **Glimmer Pebble**: A small stone that emits a soft, ambient glow in darkness but does not provide enough light to illuminate anything beyond a few inches. Adds eerie ambiance rather than practical utility.

3. **Echoing Shell**: A seashell that, when held to the ear, plays the sounds of a distant battlefield—clanging swords, war cries, and orders shouted over the din.

4. **Chill Cloth**: A handkerchief that feels perpetually cold to the touch. Useful for cooling overheated tempers or offering solace in stress.

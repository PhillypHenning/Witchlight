# Recap
- The party spent 3 months lost in the repeating landscapes of the fog before finally finding somewhere new
- The party has begun their exploration of the Twilight Grove
    - Karag speaking giant spoke to the Mud Giant whom told him of him being on time-out
        - Karag curious inquired who exactly "Mr. Hats" was, to which the Mud Hulk told him it was his friend but he got mad earlier and sent him here
    - Di meanwhile went another route, in one room he met a strange druid and in the other a small band of kobolds
        - The druid mentioned his intentions of fixing the Twilight Grove which lay on the other side of the map
        - The kobolds not understanding Di mostly barked commands at him which went unlistened to.
    - Karag like a bullet travelled right to Mr. Hats who seemed to be some sort of shadow demon. Unfortuntately for him he was stuck as a everburning torch seems to have fallen at the mouth of the cave and his only exit
    - The party left off as Di and Terran survayed an absolutely filthy room crawling with all sorts of vermin and Karag, Yanaba and Sevro were in combat with hostile living spells.

# Beat
## Exploring the dungeon
1. The garbage shot
    - Anyone who breathes in the area becomes sick (disadv Con saving checks)
    - The centipedes and rot grubs will eventually attack
    - The mud mephits
        - Speak terran (language of the earth)
        - Aren't overly interested in the newcomers
    - The thick door (Boss) at the end of the hallway is sealed, layed into the wall near the top right corner are 3 strange glass looking canisters, one of which glows with arcane energy.
        - The three canisters need to be energiezed to open the door. They can be activated via the switches in the other 3 rooms. 1 of which is currently turned on from a dead body hitting it.
    - Rooms
        1. Switch is on, 2x mundane items, 1x mundane magical items, 1x scroll
        2. Switch is off, 2x mundane items, 1x mundane magical items
        3. Switch is off, 3x mundane items, 1x mundane magical items, 1x magical item
2. Dragon Statue room 1
    - One flaming hand remains
    - The statue holds a large amethyst of deep purple. Putting it up to one's ear, the faint sound of a heart beat can be heard. It's hot to the touch, but not so much that it burns.
    - This orb is what the Kobolds are looking for, upon seeing it they will try to take it though they are unwilling to die, instead upon taking damange they will run away to go get the rest of their nest
3. The scar
    - Small bits of light filter through small holes in the rocks. At some points it barely feels 5 feet thick.

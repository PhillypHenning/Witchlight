# Beats
1. The purple dragon heart
    - If given to the Kobolds,
        - The kobolds again begin their ritual, this time however, a shockwave of energy pulses out of the glowing prison holding the dragon
        - The prison breaks and the dragon falls to the ground
2. Dragon awoken
    - Attacking Karag shouting "Ka-Rok-Tar, you shall die!", before looking around and realizing that something isn't wrong
        - Regardless of what happens, she will be wary of Karag
    - If the party continues to attack, she will change to her elven persona and ask them to explain what is going on
    - She has no interest in more fighting
        - She will join the Kobolds, as they were her caretakers and she wishes to thank them
        - She is thankful to the party and provides them the following gifts
            1. **Amulet of Healthful Sleep**: This amulet ensures that while worn, the user cannot be affected by nonmagical fatigue and gains the benefits of a long rest with only 4 hours of sleep.
            2. **Breezewhisper Cloak**: Grants the wearer advantage on checks made to hide or move silently. The cloak itself appears to ripple gently, as if caught in a breeze.
3. The Harrows Grove
    - Immediately after the dragon's prison is broken, have Yanaba do a nature check (DC 12+)
        - "Your eyes are fixed to the massive tree that almost seemed to elude you until now.. how it did so you're unsure. A massive oak tree stands infront of a large rot iron door with a strange rune on it. Rotted bags and old skeletons in various states of decay hang from the many branches of the tree which seems to sag with the weight of the dead. An unbelievably sickening presence seems to be leaking from it."
        - [SUCCESSFUL_CHECK] You hear the shake of a bush nearby and turn your head. A small heap of branches sits nearby, all of its leaves have long since blown away and the spindly branches reach up as if clawing for one last breath of sunlight. In a peculiar way, the old dead bush looks almost humanoid..
4. Kobold party
    - The Kobolds ritual chanting quickly becomes celebratory as they attempt to drag Zil Von Topper off to their lair. 100s of the small creatures hang out of the many holes in the walls shouting, partying and overall having a good time
    - If the players attempt to join them they are welcomed in
        - Within the find a vibrant, albeit primitive city built into the rocks and stones
        - 100s of small dens dot the inside caverns, out of which all manner of noises issue forth
    - The kobolds lead Zil to a large den, in which every inch of floor space is taken up, moving to allow the dragon and her company past
        - Here the leaders of the tribe thank the dragon for her presence and offer to be at her side forever after, to which she chuckles but doesn't agree or disagree
        - The leaders will also give Karag a prized treasure of theirs;
            - **Glimmer Pebble**: A small stone that emits a soft, ambient glow in darkness but does not provide enough light to illuminate anything beyond a few inches. Adds eerie ambiance rather than practical utility.
5. The Harrowed ground
    - Eventually Daa'grin will make his way to the tree, where he will begin to softly cry. If asked what is the matter, the old druid will say "I know what I was brought here for now. It is all so obvious, I don't understand what I didn't see it earler. This grove was once a place of happiness and peace, now it is a mockery, cast away and forgotten. I will fix this place or burn it to the ground trying." 
    - Daa'grin will be adament that Sevro and Tarran are kept far away from him. He will however, naturally favor Karag and Yanaba
    - If Yanaba mentions what she feels he will agree and say he feels the same sorrows as she leaking from around them
6. To save a grove
    - Daa'grin will ask the party for their help in cleansing the grove, though he has nothing to offer them but the chance to do something right and noble
    - The ritual will require that two people act as channeling stones for his magic, they will be unable to attack while he channels through them (1 turn). The rest of the party will need to fend off whatever rot and unholy corruption the grove comes after them with. He is confident that the grove will fight back, not out of hate but trauma.
    - The spell will be successful when 10 turns are spent channeling

# Beats
1. Leandra will be surprised to see the party come back
    - Seeing the party come back gives her more hope than she has had in awhile but their work is yet to finish.
    - She will mention that the door lies and she remembers distinctly that there were 8 guardians at one point, though she can't remember whom the last one was.
2. Clobberclaw has met with Dea Prolif who is now sending her invisible stalkers to watch the party as they move around the castle
3. King Gloam sits on his throne beneath the castle
    - Clobberclaw will rejoin the group after they visit King Gloam
    - If asked where he went he will lie and say he was poking around the castle and lost track of Karag.

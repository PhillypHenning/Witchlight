# Twin Prince boss fight
Dusk - Halaster Horror
Dawn - Helmed Horror

## Gimicks
The princes need to be killed in the same round of combat. If one if reduced to 0 health and the other isn't killed within the same round then at the top of the round:
    1. Half the health of the current prince and give that health to the downed prince
    2. Roll 1d10 for both princes and heal them by that much

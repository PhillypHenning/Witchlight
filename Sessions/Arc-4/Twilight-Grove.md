    - Was brought down by the The Twilight Courts magician who put the creature into a magical slumber.
    - Zil Vil Zon Toper's will is great and has slowly degragaded the spell over time. Her Will has crystalized into two gems that lay within the dungeon.

- Cult of the Purple Scale
    - The Kobold collection that resides nearby and takes care of the slumbering purple dragon
    - The send the most routiest Kobolds into the dungeon in an attempt to find anything to assist in the waking of their master
        - A long while ago a single Kobold returned, Figroy, he was poisoned, set a blaze and subjected to dark magics but the small creature managed to return. He died soon after though not without leaving the cult with hope... "The dragon's will.. is here.."

- The Druid
    - A drow druid named Daa'grin
    - Daa'grin became lost in the fog a long, time ago. Since than he has been wondering the fogs, going where they take him. Recently he stumbled upon the Rot Wright Grove and sensing the deep wounds it held he decided to stay and see what he can do to help.
    - Unfortauntely he is unable to assist as the magical energy leaking from the Slumbering Dragon's containment spell interacts poorly with the spell he has prepared to cure the grove.
    - He will ask for the partys help in removing the Kobolds. He doesn't hold ill-will against them and would rather they find an ammicable way to remove them, but won't ask questions either
    - Dungeon Knowledge
        - Can tell that there are two oppressive fonts of magic somewhere in the dungeon
        - Can tell that there is a dangerous creature lurking somewhere to the South

- The Rot Wright Grove
    - Seeded with the blood, anger and war that took place between Zalbina and The Twilight Court the Twilight Grove has been left to fester and rot. The once proud flora now contageous and blighted holds the door closed to The Twilight Court.
    - The largest of the wounded plantlife is the Hanging Tree, a once gorgeous Oak tree was turned into an execution grounds.

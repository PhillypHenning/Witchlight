# Creatures and Groups
- Sleeping Purple Dragon
    - Her name is: Zil Vil Zon Toper
    - Zalbina's Ally
    - Assisted Zalbina in her attack against The Twilight Court.
    - Was brought down by the The Twilight Courts magician who put the creature into a magical slumber.
    - Zil Vil Zon Toper's will is great and has slowly degragaded the spell over time. Her Will has crystalized into two gems that lay within the dungeon.
    - Was the broodmate of Quicksilvers. The two of them had an egg shortly before she left to assist Zalbina

- Cult of the Purple Scale
    - The Kobold collection that resides nearby and takes care of the slumbering purple dragon
    - The send the most routiest Kobolds into the dungeon in an attempt to find anything to assist in the waking of their master
        - A long while ago a single Kobold returned, Figroy, he was poisoned, set a blaze and subjected to dark magics but the small creature managed to return. He died soon after though not without leaving the cult with hope... "The dragon's will.. is here.."

- Kobold search party
    - Lead by a Sorcerer named FireToes and a Warrior named Whack
    - Are looking for the Dragon's Will within the dungeon, though they are unsure what that is
    - They are routy and often get into disagreements with what to do
    - Will join the party if convinced
        - The goals of the party and the group need to align
        - Every few turns they get into an argument losing them turns while they fight

- The Druid
    - A drow druid named Daa'grin
    - Daa'grin was once a wild magic sorcerer in a life long ago. After a short life of discomfort the man found his way into the Fey where his soul immediately felt at home. He's unsure when he picked up druidism but what he does remember is the stark difference between his initial inate magical abilities and having to fail and learn slow and painfully. Druidism was not easy but now a magically increased lifetime later he has become a fine druid.
    - Daa'grin found the Rot Wright Grove after returning to find his friend King Gloam. The grove was a place of cheer and kindness, he was horified to see its current state.
    - He is unable to assist as the magical energy leaking from the Slumbering Dragon's containment spell interacts poorly with the spell he has prepared to cure the grove.
    - He will ask for the partys help in removing the Kobolds. He doesn't hold ill-will against them and would rather they find an ammicable way to remove them, but won't ask questions either
    - Dungeon Knowledge
        - Can tell that there are two oppressive fonts of magic somewhere in the dungeon, one is the sleeping dragon, the other he suspects is the groove.
        - Can tell that there is a dangerous creature lurking somewhere within, he has stayed far away from the North and East as the presence within is revolting
    - Personal knowledge
        - Was a friend of King Gloam, King of the Twilight Kingdom.
        - Though the grove is recognizable, it seems different.. more so than the twisted woods.. he can't put a finger on it but the whole place seems to be a copy of a copy. A xurox of a xurox.

- The Rot Wright Grove
    - Seeded with the blood, anger and war that took place between Zalbina and The Twilight Court the Twilight Grove has been left to fester and rot. The once proud flora now contageous and blighted holds the door closed to The Twilight Court.
    - The largest of the wounded plantlife is the Hanging Tree, a once gorgeous Oak tree was turned into an execution grounds.

# Locked Doors
- None

# Bosses
## Galnoza the crawling horror

# Events
## Rot Wight Grove

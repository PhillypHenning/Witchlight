[COMPLETE]

# Recap
1. Di and Sevro are approached by the Witch light carnival security. Di is asked to put the giant snake away as it's scarying the guests, which Di complies to. Sevro on the other hand misinterprets the whole situation and gets hauled off for a punishment by the tall red haired security guard.

3. Nuff with Yanaba are approached by Grandma Stoutfoot who gives them both cosys for their weapons.
4. Di bumped into a fellow Follower of the Forge god named Alcal Brightstrike whom after a lively and friendly conversation traded his current project for a traveling anvil that's capable of shrinking and growing as needed. 
5. At the end of the session the group are approached by Burly who is worried about the Witchlight and Mr. W/L. He believes that potentially stealing something needed by Mr. W/L will gain them the leverage they need to force their hands and spill the beans on what is going on.

#### Heist thoughts and notes
- Expanded Thaco
    - Burly won't be involved so Thaco will act as the only line of defense between the party and the stop watch. Therefor it will be required to give him a boost.
        1. Give him a legendary action
            - Summon balloon animals. Instead of rolling he summons the max number.
        2. Passive perception will be high: 15
        3. He will get three new actions:
            1. Balloon boy, create 3 balloons that give Thaco a 30foot hover speed
            2. Balloon animal, create 1 of four balloon guard animals
                - 1d10 balloon squirels (Rat stat block) [minimum of 5]
                - 1d8 balloon crows (blood hawk stat block) [minimum of 4]
                - 1d6 balloon spiders (giant wolf spider)
                - 1d4 balloon crocodiles
            3. Balloon scream, Any creatures within 15 feet must make a DC 12 wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 round

- Mr. Witch keeps the watch on him at all times. The party will need some one to deal with him (non-violently). If threatened Mr. Witch will attempt to get to his trailer which has a sturdy lock (DC 15 lock picking) and a reinforced bar (DC 15 atheletics). The trailer is also equiped with a loud speaker, additionally Mr. L/W keep 3 humming birds within the tent that are trained to fly out to: Granny stoutfoot who will muster a handful of Witchlight hands, Burly, who will ignore the bird for as long as he reasonably can, and Dilgraun.

- Mr. Witches pocket watch can tighten security if need be by thickening the briar around the employee area. Additionally he can change how it acts by making it not open / close to employees.

- Mr. L/W will fight if need be, especially if they have no other choice or are presented with lethal damage. If the party uses lethal damage they will immediately call for all guards.

- If the party uses lethal damage and win, Mr. L/W will reluctantly bring them to the Prismeer entrance. They will open it and (if given the chance) kick the group through.
- If the party uses non-lethal damage and loses, then they will be either need to pay a 100 gold fine (which can be paid back in magic items) or be permanantly kicked out of the carnival.

- If the party successful gets the watch then they will have won a bargining chip. Burly will offer to bring Mr. L/W to them for a private meeting in which they can bargin to gain access to the entrance to the Feywild.
    - Mr. Witch will be honest, he wants the watch back enough that he would be willing to do just about anything 
    - Mr. Light is much more vindictive and willing to lie. If asked for more, he will agree to the additional items/gold but will insist that they come with him to the portal first. Once the pocket watch is in his hands he will open the portal and have them pulled through. His last words being "ta-ta" said with a scowl. 

    - You approach the old, wood rimmed mirror, it's colors yellowed with age. From it you hear a low thrum carry through the air, the tall standing mirrors of the Hall of Illusions around it ever so slightly vibrating. You can smell the old attraction, the many years of visitors hanging in the air like the light mists of dew drop morning. As you step closer still other smells waft by, the smell of mud and trees briefly catching you before they are replaced by smells of open ocean.

    The thin elf in-front of you, cane in hand confidently walks to the side of the mirror. He stops short a moment, before producing a handcloth from within in sleeve. "I love kids but I really wish they wouldn't press their face into our mirrors so often." He bends down and begins inspecting the mirror "Whomever did this clearly doesn't have all his thoughts in order.. and judging by the number of times he mashed his face into the mirror, I doubt he left with more brain then he started with"

    The slim elf then addresses you earnestly, "Everything you're looking for can be found through the looking glass."
    The hefter elf adds, "And just so you know, this will be a one way ticket. We do hope to see you again at our carnival one day, but this mirror is a portal to the ancient feywild realm of prismeer. Once you step through you will need to find another way back. Though you crafty lot shouldn't have to hard of a time with that I imagine."

    The slim elf nods in agreement, spends a moment looking you over, his eyes lingering on Nuff a moment. "Nuff darling, will you be staying with us, or heading with the fine chaps back to your homeland?"

        - If questioned about it: "Well of course, you were born in Prismeer darling. The feywild is your country and Prismeer your hometown.. so to speak. I'm sure if you looked you might even find... oh what were their names again.." Mr. Witch: "Turnip and Petal" Mr. Light: "That's right! Turnip and Petal, your older brothers."
    
    "Well then let's not keep dilly dallying at the final act." The slim elf gracefully turns on a foot and faces the mirror. "Hither, thither, here and there", from beside him the larger elf continues. "wander yonder, show me where". A bright flash of light erupts from the middle of the mirror, splitting the mirror into 3, a shard of dark green, a shade of bright green and one of moon lit blue. A swirling mist begins to creep from the mirror, then onto the floor. From the floor it seems to claw forward until reaching your feet. It begins twisting up your legs and you feel as your sense of gravity suddenly begins to shift, and you're each dragged into the mirror one by one.

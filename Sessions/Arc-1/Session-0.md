# Intros
## Witchlight Hand
As you sit in the wooden carriage, looking through a clean circular window you see an explosion of brilliant colors as the Witchlight carnival explodes through a portal and back in to the material plane. You've been traveling for about a day or so through the space between spaces, a wild and wonky place where time is up and up is yellow. As a Witchlight hand, you're becoming more and more use to the intricies of how all this functions. You'll spend a week or two here bringing delight to the young and old and before you know it Mr. Witch and Mr. Light will have the place packed up and heading elsewhere.. or is it elsetime? No matter.

This is the first time in some time that you seem to have arrived back in Faerun, the world of you your birth, during a time period that was close to when you left it. From what you have overheard around you, the Witchlight Carnival is setting up outside the large bustling town of Waterdeep.

The carriage you're in quickly begins to descend, like a dragon swooping down for their latest meal, the motion always puts your stomach on edge. From your window you see clouds, then tree tops, then tree middles then finally the ground and after a short time you feel your carriage coming to a stop.

You take a breath and step out of your carriage. Just ahead of you, Northwind, a fellow Witchhand, is whispering to the nearby trees which promptly uproot themselves to move out of the way creating a large clearling for the carnival to begin setting up in. Where the clearing has begun many other witchhands attend to various tasks. The Merfolk, Palasha, within her oversized fishbowl swirls and dances and as she does the ground soaks with water creating a the lazy river ride. Other witchhands work here and there as well, beginning to put their attractions up in their usual spots.

A curious sight catches your eye.. A Kenkun in black garb quickly runs from the forest's edge and into the carnival.. Strange, you don't remember seeing a kenkun Witchlight when you last left Orgrimmar.

Regardless, there is some time between now and when your job as a Witchhand will begin, what will you do with it?

- Runs after the Kenku and has to be reminded about his wings.

The day keeps getting stranger still as Mr. Light as requested your audience. You head over to the employee tents where you find the ringmasters carivan. Within the two ringmasters are speaking but become hushed as you draw near.

Mr. Light: "Ahh __Name__ I see you got my request. We've been here not 2 hours and already there is mischief about, no doubt because we decided to park so close to Waterdeep. *sigh* None the less, we have a special assignment for you this carnival. To begin with, we seem to have an intruder in our midst, you may have seen him. A kenkun has inflitrated, and though those who come here without a ticket leave without something precious to them, I fear this urchin seeks an even greater damage. Find the black Kenkun and make sure he doesn't return.. *Mr. Light looks to Mr. Witch who is staring at him* preferably without death. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, a bard, first in line, purchased additional tickets and yet asked to keep her identity unknown, this seems strange. We'd like you to join the group and keep an eye on them, Nickolas will contact you when they arrive so you can join them.


## FeyLost
Sleep takes hold of you quickly as you lay down after a day of activities. Your body becomes still and calm, your muscles begin to relax and as usual a swirl of color plays in your minds eye, twisting and turning in every which direction until finally the comfortable numbness of slumber begins to overtake you.

You feel your spirit begin rising up into the air, the weightlessness making you feel as though you're flying. A brilliant rainbow of colors flash in every direction around you. You move threw this place between places for a few moments, after which you see below you a deep friendly fog surrounding a green meadow. Trees of green, red and yellow encircle the soft greens, swaying in a non-existant wind together from side to side. You could almost swear you hear faint whispers from them.. a song long forgotten, or perhaps being made-up as it's sung?

You feet touch soft green grass which tickle the bottoms, looking down you see a small dandelion grow up between your toes, one of its green leaves waves at you before plucking itself from the earth and walking off on thin roots. 

You've been here before in this place between places and during those trips you've meet many strange creatures, most of which were friendly. Tonight however something seems.. off and while you ponder a small rain cloud forms over your head. You look up as the first drops begin to fall.

"Careful travler, this place is primordial at the best of times, but as of late the energy has become wilder then ever." You glance around looking for the speaker. From within the forest shadows a set of dangerous eyes stare at you. "Begone shadow! Go back to your master and leave our friendly traveler in peace!" the same voice booms from behind you. It takes all of your will to not immediately spin to face the speaker, the eyes from the shadow linger a moment before fading.

Turning around you see the blue spirit of a unicorn looking at you. It stands strong and magnificient with shoulders pulled back with a still readiness. The whisps of his memory curl off his body where his tail and mane would be had he been material. "Dark creatures have begun to infiltrate Prismeer, I'm sorry if it startled you." It continues, "Though I wish I could stay here for longer, I have a finite amount of time before I must leave to keep you and my lost love safe. May I ask of you a favor?"

"My darling waits for me by still waters that she has enchanted. Find her within Prismeer and tell her I live. Do this and I will find a prize worthy of your heroism." As the final words are uttered the spirit slips away into whisps, dragged into the forest by a cold wind. 

You look up to see a thunder cloud has formed overhead, the energy radiating downwards towards you. From within the dark clouds you can see the shapes of 3 creatures spinning with the storm and as lightening arcs into the ground close by, you could swear that under the accomponing thunder you hear grotesque cackling.


## Lost Things
The carnival is in town and you being the young, occasional deliquent, have decided to sneak in. You wish you had some gold to pay for a ticket, but sadly you were unable to acquire any but only a dunce would let that stop them. A quick nip in and out, just to see, that wouldn't hurt anyone.

Sneaking in wasn't hard, everyone is so caught up with the banners of light that float threw the air, the strange funny men dancing about, and the wild and zanny to pay you any mind. 

(As what their lost thing is. Try and work in how that lost thing was something they were proud of, or cherished in some way)

You slip around from attraction to stall games, until you find yourselves behind a rather smelly stables. You peek in and see a man washing down a few horse sized snails.. curious! two men dressed in tight leather lean on some nearby railings holding smokes and speaking. You overhear something about "the last race was rigged, I should have won it"

Suddenly you get a tingle down the back of your spine. Someone.. or soemthing is watching you. You peer around, all you see are people in groups, families and friends laughing and enjoying presents companies. That is until your eyes land on a strange creature watching you from a short distance away.

1. Cas, From the other side of the street you see a small grey skinned girl, awkwardly standing and staring towards you. Normally this wouldn't spook you but this girl is wearing a realistic pigs mask over hers and you could almost swear you hear a pig squeel in an amongst the murmur of the crowd. 

2. Emil, Within a nearby stall a woman dressed in black wisps stares at you. She lifts her hand to her mouth and giggles, her head bobbing up and down all the while her strange moon mask on the side of her head has a motionlessness to it that unnerves you.

Both of you begin to develop a headache in the back of your head. You blink and the figures are suddenly gone. Strange that. You try and stay to enjoy the carnival a bit longer, but the pain in the back of your mind pushes you to leave early. 

As you do (describe how the thing they lost is now gone)


## A request from an old friend
1. Run the intro as normal, however near the end run the following

Madryck suddenly stops before quickly looking to the door. *knock knock knock 3 raps at the door fill the void within the hut. Madryck looks to you all "Please do not threaten this creature. Even if she deserves it". The old man walks to the door and reaches out to grip the handle. He hesitates a moment before lifting the latch and swinging the door open. On the other side is a small child sized woman with soft brown freckles and fiery hair, a large smile plays at across her cheeks that just to say covers insidious intentions. 

"Mad Madryck! I knew you'd be home. May I come in?"
Madryck grumbles acceptance and the small creature floats inside. 

"The carnival is in town and so I thought I'd take the chance to come catch up with my favorite Pumpkin grower." - Sophie

"More crops needed for your grim harvest? You should be kinder to them and with them Sophie." - Madryck

"Yes.. but! if one wishes to join an established coven, one needs to be rotten" - Sophie says with a wink

Outside the door 3 children stand holding 3 pumpkinsin their hands. Each of the children where white masks with long noses and large unfriendly smiles.

"I see you have new friends with you." - Madryck inquires

"Yes! Small darlings that I swept away to a better life. They call themselves the Wildlings." - Sophie

Madryck mumbles once again before continuing "The rule of generousity is in order." 

"Well of course, for these crops I tell you this, Prismeer is now owned by 3 instead of 1." - Sophie smiles a wicked smile. "And with that I must get going, sorry to bother you and your, casting an eye towards you, "friends. Ta-ta"

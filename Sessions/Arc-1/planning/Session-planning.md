# Hither Arc
1. Arrival in Hither
2. Out of controll balloon
2. The Longscarf Gang investigates the balloon
3. Slanty Tower 
    - Plea from help from Talafar
        - He has no idea where the key to his cage is
    - Meeting or killing (the Ettin)
        - Will tell them about both Jingle Jangle and The Watcher if they end up speaking
4. Run in with the Chesshire Cat (Puca)
    - Provides them a few warnings if they can make him laugh
        - Warns about Iron Jaw's roving bandits, one being Longscarf the other being Myers
4. Brigand's Tollway 1 (Encounter outside)
    - This should be a bit of an overwhelming encounter where the bandits beat and steal from the party
5. Escaping from Myers Swamp
    - The party will wake up in some rough cages, just as Longscarf's men are leaving
    - Myers will come home shortly after but won't head down right away
    - The point of this encounter is to have them try and sneak their way out or alternatively they could fight the Ogre
6. Watcher's Pool
    - If asked how to get to Thither she will mention ClapperClaw and YarnSpinner as options
7. Brigand's Tollway 2 (Encounter inside)
    - The party will likely want to get their belongings back
8. Telemy Hill to meet Jingle Jangle
    - She has a sense for these things and if Telefar's cage is brought she instinctively will know that the key is being held in Downfall or somewhere in Bavlorna's cottage
9. Downfall

## Notes on Hither
- Telafar
    - His key will be in Downfall with the king / prison warden or within Bavlorna's cottage

- The Longscarf crew will inquire about Yanaba and ask her why she's with the player party. They'll imply that she must have hit her head as a kit (baby rabbit) and invite her to join them at their hideout. 

- Random encounters
    1. At some point during their stay, Faries will attempt to snatch up Sevro to bring to their master
        - Pointy Hat's free adventure
    2. Caught in a mushroom field they must find their way out
    3. The Cheshire Puca
    4. A large battlefield where the undead will get up and re-enact a massive battle everyday, just as the party is traveling through it

## Big Top Event
The lights dim and a hush falls over the crowd. A second later, a spotlight illuminates a lithe, elven figure sitting in a silver hoop, suspended above the center ring by silk ropes. The elf wears a dazzling suit of diamond-pane mirrors and a pair of butterfly wings. His scepter is topped with a spinning vane.

"Welcome, one and all, to this evening's extravaganza! I am Mister Light. Prepare to be delighted!"

The Aerial Acrobats of Illusion

The lights dim, and the sound of mystical music fills the air. Suddenly, a group of skilled performers takes center stage, their bodies adorned in shimmering costumes that seem to come to life. The aerial acrobats gracefully ascend on long ribbons suspended from the rafters, their bodies twisting and turning with effortless precision. They twirl and spin in mid-air, defying gravity as they perform mesmerizing loops and daring drops. Their movements fluid and seamless, they create illusions of flying through the enchanted world of dragons and mythical creatures. Gasps and applause fill the tent as the acrobats descend, leaving the audience spellbound by their ethereal performance.

The Fire-Dancing Elementalists

Next a massive bonfire appears in the middle of the Big Top, its crackling flames dancing to a hypnotic rhythm. Shadows flicker across the faces of the excited audience as a haunting melody begins to play. From the darkness, four figures emerge, their bodysuits illuminating in vibrant shades of red and gold. Each performer wields flaming torches, their precision and control showcasing the mastery of their craft. As they move to the beat of the music, the fire-dancing elementalists execute a breathtaking choreography, seamlessly passing the flames between each other while executing gravity-defying flips and spins. The heat from the fire intensifies, immersing the audience in an otherworldly experience. Sparks fly, illuminating the night sky, creating an enchanting spectacle that leaves the audience in awe of the elementalists' skill and the power of fire.

---
The Juggler's Symphony

A jazzy tune fills the tent, setting a lively atmosphere. The jugglers enter, clad in brightly patterned suits, their smiles infectious and their eyes twinkling with mischief. With a flick of their wrists, the performance starts, as they effortlessly juggle balls, rings, and pins, their movements so precise you can hardly believe they are real. The tempo of the music increases, challenging the jugglers to push their limits further.

---
*Boom Boom thud* Shrieks of delight ripple out from the other side of the tent.
*Boom thud.. THUD* Shrieks of panic radiate out from the other side of the tent. You watch as people begin scrambling down and away from the bleachers on the far side of the tent. A moment later with a thunderous wooden crack the bleachers explode outward sending splinters and people across the ground as a large grey elephant bursts through the bleachers and into middling section. From behind the elephant 2 large lions with a thick mane stalks outward glancing from left to right eagerly. Screams of panic erupt from all around and the Big Top Event ruptures into chaos.


### Combat

- Elephant
    - The elephant is frightened having just been attacked by the lions and now being seemingly trapped with small shrill creatures. It will want to move away from the lions as quickly as possible. If attacked it will focus on stomping out the threat. It can be calmed with a Animal Handling check of 18 per turn.
- Lions
    - 1 Lion will go after a group of fleeing children only for Mr. Light to step in and save them
    - The other lion will stalk towards fleeing humans near the party. If attacked the creature will viciously attack back. If it kills someone, the lion will grab the corpse and make a run for it back where it came.
- Monkeys
    - The 2 of the Monkeys will annoy the crowd, the other 2 will focus on messing with the players by taking things from them.

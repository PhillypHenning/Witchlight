# Recap
- Intro Recap
    - The Witchlight Carnival is a fairground of kaleidoscopic tents and wagons crewed by wondrous beings. Having arrived recently in the area you have all found yourselfs entering the fairgrounds for each of your own reasons. 
        - Di and Sevro you've arrived to search for an entrace to the Feywild at the request of their old friend Madryck. Madryck asked you to find his patron, Zalbina and ensure she is alive and safe as his connection to her has recently terminated, worrying him deeply.
        - Karag and Mellow you've each found yourself here under auspicious circumstances. In each of your pasts you stole a visit to the Witchlight carnival and while there you had something stolen from you in turn. Your feet have found there way here as if compelled to discover what was stolen and by whom.
        - Yanaba you've always been a bit... out of place. Your parents, family and village loved you deeply and would stick up for you through thick and thin.. but it was never lost on you that they were humans and you, most certainly were not. After a strange dream in which you traveled to a brilliant and strange world and met a gentle soul asking for help you decided to put that quant life behind you and forge your own destiny. Not knowing where to start, you let the wind carry you forward which has brought you to a strange and dazzling carnival.
        - Nuff you've known only the carnival ever since you were a little faerie. You grew up surrounded by the bright colors and cheery individuals. Your youngest memory is of you and Burly chasing a nude streaker out of the carnival. You've trained and become strong by wrestling the goblin triplets. These are your friends and family and in a way Mr. Witch and Mr. Light are your dads. You go where you go and you go with a vibin soul, and this is how you've found yourself in the company of a strange group of carnival attendees.

# Session notes
1. Kettlesteam will be responsible for messing with the animal cages and collars. She did this to cause a distraction. During the BigTop event, the Kenku will sneak into the Hall of Illusions and will disappear into Prismeer.
    - Candlefoot will have seen the Kenku enter and after following her in, will see her disappear into Prismeer and worried, will seek out the party to help find the creature. (Though he isn't actually aware that Kettlesteam has his voice)

2. If approached, Ellywick will tell Yanaba that a few friends of hers are in need of help and after a dream she came to the Witchlight in hopes to find her. One of her friends is Elidon who she suspects has been captured by whomever took over her Patron's Fey realm of Prismeer. Unfortunately Ellywick is not able to travel to Prismeer herself, she has tried but when she tries to cross something rebukes her entrance. She suspects this was something done by whomever stole Prismeer from her Patron.

3. Burly will be looking to speak to Nuff after the BigTop event. He is worried about his brother and suspects that Mr. Witch and Mr. Light know where he and many others have disappeared to. He will explain that he suspects that the scary creatures that steal things from folks are to blame and will ask Nuff to find his brother for him. Mr. Witch and Mr. Light aren't likely to give up information freely for whatever reason, so it is likely that Nuff and his new friends will need to steal something valuable from them to force their hand.

1. Quick wit and deadly sheens
    - The players will be introduced to QueckSilber, an adult Mercury dragon whom has made Prismeer his home long ago. QueckSilber is a collector of many things, but his favorites are armors.
    - QueckSilber will act as a merchant for the group. He has a few extra items he's willing to trade. He's only interested in items he doesn't yet have.
    - If a player steals from QueckSilber, he will ambush them as they begin to lay camp to get back his possession. He will forbid the entire party from entering his lair again, though he can be won back over with a magical item of great power.
    - QueckSilber is the only creature in all of Prismeer who knows how a Vorpal blade can be made. As one of his prize possessions the dragon will be very unlikely to trade for it unless something of great value is given for it.

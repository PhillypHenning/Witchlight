# Recap
Where did the party leave off?

The party:
1. Escaped Hither by running into the fog, the mad frogs of Downfall hot on their heels, in hot pursuit to take back the crown stolen by Sevro
2. After stumbling around in the fog the landscape around them twists and turns before solidifying into a strange castle, identified by Clobberclaw as Castle Twilight.
3. Within, the party fought their way through a gauntlet of forgotten peoples and their disregarded dreams. Beginning with the twin princes Gloam and Dusk and their guardians. Pulled further in, they descended down a ladder found in a strange corner of the castle. Below the castle was surprisingly .. another castle, older than the one above, which itself was crumbling. The liminal space they found themself in was strange and disorienting, seemingly turning back on itself in a loop. 
4. It was here Sevro died and his true undead nature became apparent, though the source of the undeath is still unknown. 
5. Finally, the party found a desecrated garden with a single massive, twisted and gnarled tree in the middle. The fight was long and tough, a victory hard-won.

## Leaving Castle Twilight
The grove behind you feel calm.. or at least calmer than it did when you first stepped foot into it. The bodies of the countless corrupted creatures that fought to protect the desecrated tree are scattered around the grove and already you can see the small forms of Kobolds beginning to scavanage through them. Funny, you think to yourself, those small creatures are the first to run away at any sign of trouble and the first to run towards when the trouble has been dealt with. The corrupted vegetation holds no value to you anymore regardless, the twisted bow in Yanaba's hands seemingly being the largest reward for your collective victory. 

The sound of grinding stone emits from the stone-face wall of the cave on the far side of the grove. Crunching and crackling, two large stone doors swing open, between the same dense grey fog that brought you here cane be seen swirling and voidless. It seems that Castle Twilight is giving you permission to leave at last.

A quiet moment sits between you. (Ask: Unless there is anything else you wish to do before leaving, who is the first person to walk towards the now open doors and into the fog?)

## The abandon cottage in the woods

Just like when you entered the fog from Hither, you feel as though you have been walking through the blank expanse of space for a lifetime. Castle Twilight was behind you one moment, and then it was gone. The grey nothing engulfing it and everything else in all directions endlessly. In the beginning you were keeping an eye out for anything to distinguish your path but you quickly gave that up as it didn't seem to matter much anyway. Time passes, you walk. Time passes you walk. Time passes you walk.

Time passes and .. you see something a head. Something not grey. Something boxy and brown, with egress built into the side that seemed to let things be seen from either side of them. With a rectangular entryway, closed tight with lock and coupler. With something like the fog but darker slowly pouring out of the rectangle on the top of the whole thing. 

Such a strange thing, you think to yourself, what were these called again .. The fog seemingly clouding your mind, "a cubby? a hovel ... a house?" The last thought catches in your head and you realize how drained you were feeling even a moment ago. Yes this is a house, people live in these houses. What was it doing here though? You open your mouth to ask it before catching how silly of an idea that is, you don't speak house. (Ask the party to check their languages in case anybody speaks house). 

A quaint little cottage made of thick, cured timbers in the fog and presumably someone is home judging from the black smoke emitting from the chimney.

[PLAYERS] What would you like to do?

### Windows
You look through the windows, the clutter catches your eye first, then the movement of small things within. Books, bottles, laundry and foods dot every surface within. 

### Out-Back
The stocks of a dozen different vegetables and herbs sprout from well laid plots of dark dirt. Garden supplies lean on the cottage walls and a short distance off is the crank and pipe of a well. It seems the owner has a green thumb.

### Door
The tumbler and handle is made of wrought-iron. The handle has a satisfying twist to it while the tumbler has a magnificent and sharp "Z" etched into it.

### Inside the Cottage
The cabin door slides open easily with a small creeaaakk. The cottage walls are made of thick logs and a green-grey moss fills the spaces between them, on them hang haphazard shelves and hooks holding all manner of apparel and knick-knack. Tables and cabnets dot the spaces around, on them parchements, books, candles and more. A large cauldron hangs above a lit fireplace which crackles softly, the contents within the cast-iron stew pot bubble and roil sending a sweet and savoury arouma into the air. A feather rises off a parchment and dips itself into an ink well before returning to the page and continuing where it left off. A book on a stand crinkles as it turns a page. A broom sweeps itself into view sending dust into the air on either side of it before dancing off behind another piece of furniture. In addition to all of this, a half-dozen phantom hands zip around the room, filling ink wells, grabbing vials and bringing them over near the couldron and stirring the pots.

### Baba Yaga arrives
- Di, Karag, Sevro, Yanaba
[NOTE] Have the players in sequence roll a perception check while they check out the cottage. If they succeed they hear something rumble not so far away.

Boom boom, the sound is close enough to shake the house, the paintings and shelves on the wall shuddering from it. Boom boom boom, the sound continues to get closer and has the cadence of .. a chicken walking? Boom boom, boom boom. You hear the sound of trees outside shifting and moving, parting for whatever is coming closer. You look out the windows are startled to see a thick forest surrounding the cottage though you don't remember them being there when you first entered. Boom.

Outside the cottage, but 30 feet away, a second wooden shack, much like the one you're in now, hovers high in the sky on a pair of thick chicken legs. One leg scratches the other for a moment then stiffens and bends bringing the shack back down towards the ground. (Cackling fills the air) He. He. He. He. He. The door creaaaaaks open, a warm air rushes in sending the candles around the room to flicker from the intrusion. Silhoutted in the doorway stands the figure of a crooked woman. Long white hair brushed back in clumps crown her head, a large worty nose protruds from between two deep yellow eyes. The woman looks around the space, her eyes floating over each of you in turn, taking you in no different than the furniture that you stand between. "I'm surprised to find you here, ohh I quite liked you when I visited." The woman seems to reminisce to herself, "though you have some new additions".

### Endyln arrives

A crack of thunder outside the house jolts all of you, the feeling of something unexpected and hateful fills the air.

The woman side eyes you, then lifts her hand in an arcing motion atop of you, "Keep quiet for a moment." she instructs. A thrum sound plays in your ears and the world begins to grow around you, the walls and furniture becoming taller and taller at an alarming rate. Things begin to stretchhhh and you soon find yourself standing beside a salt shaker about the same size as you are ontop of a table cloth. "Did the house grow or did I just shrink?" You think to yourself. The woman stands like a giant in the same spot still side eyeing you. "Quiet I said, shh shh".

Another loud crack of thunder followed by another rumbles outside much closer. Rain begins to pelt the windows, the walls and the door. Tik Tik Tik (Like rain) Y

BOOM. Something, slams into the door and the house falls silent. The phantom hands within hide, the animate objects stiffen and hold their positions. The tumbler begins to lift slowly, draaaaaggging up the metal with a long, slow grind. Approaching the climax like death to a new corpse it hangs at the precipe for a moment, then in a moment latch lets go, the door slams open, hitting the wall and sending dust into the air, potions and books from the shelves to the floor and putting the candle fires out blanketing the cottage in darkness.

A terrible figure stands outside the door, a thick angry storm rolling behind her. A black wedding dress, ripped, torn and shredded drips down to the ground covering its legs, however many there might be. A porcelain mask with painted black eyes sits on a "sharp" head the face beneath just visible, massive dagger teeth adorning a lipless mouth stretches out from behind it. The chest of the woman has been completely carved out from bottom of the ribcage down to the top of the pelvis. An exposed spine, with gore still attached acting like a terrible echo of what should be there.

Endyln: "Why is it when I begin to forget about you something drags you back to life. Your persistence is what I hate most about you, that and the pretty face." The poison almost physically leaks from the creature. "You arrived here quick. I began to move the moment I sensed this place come back into view and yet here you are like you've been here for days. Did you hide her precious things on me mother?"

Baba Yaga: "I'm surprised that you're surprised Endyln. I would have thought a witch of your power along with your sisters would have seered this potential happening. Tsk Tsk, I give you too much credit it seems" 

The tall creature seethes for a moment, a sound somewhere between a snakes hiss and a lions growl escaping her throat.

Endyln: "Do not mock me old woman."

Baba Yaga: "I wouldn't dare do such a thing"

Another angry hiss escapes from the spindly creature. Endyln looks slowly around the cottage (DC 12 stealth) in a smooth motion, not stopping on any one thing for to long. "Would be a terrible tragedy if something were to burn this retched place to salt and ash, wouldn't it?"

Baba Yaga: "I imagine your dear sister Zylbina would be furious"

Endlyn: "Then I suppose it's a good thing she's gone."

Baba Yaga: "For now."

A cold silence fills the space between the two creatures for an uncomfortable amount of time.

Endyln: "Underestimate me at your own peril foolish woman.", she turns and heads for the door
[FAILED_STEALTH_CHECK] A deep, dark yellow eye with the pupil of a snake behind the porcelain mask stares at you as the giant like figure passes. She walks through the door, which slams behind her and sends you off balance for a moment. The storm begins to receed, the rain pouring onto the windows quickly becoming a slow drizzle then stopping altogether. 

The remaining creature turns towards you her eye alight with fire and mischief.

"Daughters are such a handful" she says through a wide grin. "She isn't the first nor will be the last of my problems I suspect He He He He." Her eyes scan each of you slowly and studiously "Yanaba of many things, Di the undecided, Sevro the theif king and Karag the forgotten heir of twilight. Quite the eclectic collection you bunch are."

[GIVE_THE_PLAYERS_SPACE_TO_SAY_SOMETHING]

#### Who are you?
- "I am Baba Yaga, mother of witches and hags"

#### What are you doing here?
- "This cottage belongs to a daughter of mine, Zylbina, who's been missing for some time. I was rather fond of Zylbina, to the chagrin of her many sisters. When I felt her presence, I came to see what it was and found the cottage and you within"

#### Who was that?
- "That was Endlyn Nightgrave, one of my daughters. She along with her 2 sisters, Skabatha and Bavlorna, are a constant pain in my side. Though admittedly I do enjoy antangonizing her, she has a fun sense of humour and whismy"

#### Can we help you?
- "I doubt you can help me, the problems I face are much larger than the mortal concerns you are capable of"

#### The end of the conversation
"This was a nice little chat, thank you for amusing me for a short while, but alas I can hear sounds in the distance that require my attention." Though you strain your ears you hear nothing of what she speaks of.

[IF_THEY_DIDN'T_ALREADY_RAID_THE_PLACE] "Grab a few supplies from around the house, I'm sure Zylbina won't notice"

"Now then, I must ask that we all leave together" She raises her hand in the air and the cottage begins to shrink around you as you become, what you hope is, the right size again. "I would see the cottage stay as I remember her in it .. that and if Endyln does make good on her threat I don't want you lot trapped inside. He He He He"

As the last of you file out of the cottage the door shuts itself with a small creaaaaak. Large, thick trees surround you on all sides and stretch off into the distance in every direction, the grey fog twisting and swirling between the trunks and over the foilage. The old woman walks back towards the hut on chicken legs with a patient stride. "See you next time darlings", her hand casually waving back at you.

## Welcome to Thither
You pick a direction and begin to walk, finding a path between the trees that you suspect was made by small fauna. The canopy above you casts dark shadows below. The underbrush beneath your feet thick and tangled. Regardless you trudge on and into..

Thither. (Change map to Thither)




# Random Encounters (d20)

## 1. Yarnspinner “Editor”
A single Yarnspinner “editor” appears, irritated that the party’s story is getting “inconsistent.” They offer to “fix the narrative” in exchange for a memory or a secret. If refused, the party finds themselves heading towards either the casino or spa.

## 2. VIP Invitations
Dozens of glossy invitations hang from twine between trees, each addressed to a party member by name. Taking one causes a faint, warm brand-like itch on the wrist (no damage); later, casino staff recognize it as “VIP marking.”

## 3. Flying Rocking Horse
Cackling fills the sky; you look up overhead and watch a large wood doll riding a flying rocking horse sail across the sky.

## 5. Casino Enforcers (Bearded Devils)
Party runs into 2 Bearded Devils, employees of the Casino, disguised as humans in fine red clothing.
The two will ask the party whether they know of the Starved Goblin Casino and when they plan to visit. They will become more and more pushy if the party doesn't seem interested, offering up to "VIP and the first 6 games free"

## 6. Raining Cats and Dogs
It begins raining cats and dogs. As the party what they do as the creatures begin to rain from the sky down onto them. Anyone who doesn't take cover needs to make a DC 14 dex check or take 2d6/2 damage.

## 7. Gaberwhocky vs. Owlbear
An owlbear stocks into a small clearing ahead of you. The large creature has purple feathers and a large sharp beak. It stands up on its two back legs and begins sniffing the air.

DC 18 CHArisma check, on a fail the member is effected by confusion and can't move from where they stand watching the creature.

A strange babble fills the air and worms itself into your ears. The sound of mad men, of yellow kings and nightmare dreamscapes. There is a wooo-osh overhead as a greasy, scalying body the size of a tower passes overhead and slams into the owlbear you have been watching. A shrill screech escapes the owlbear for but a moment, then a meaty crunching noise, then silence. The babbling stops as the dragon-like creature begins to feast on its prey leaving you with a headache and queasy stomach.


## 8. Cotton Candy Bushes
Cotton candy bushes cluster along the path. Running between them are sugar-goblins who snatch and ravenously eat the cotton candy bushes. If the players attempt to take any, the goblins attack them. The sugar goblins are for the most part neutral and can speak goblin.

## 9. Victim of Never Leave
A bloody mess of a man with fingers missing and chunks taken out of him wanders the forest, whimpering about “wanting to hit the spa to feel better.”

## 10. Victim of the Casino
A hollow husk of a woman stands in a clearing staring off into space. If approached she begs the party for any valuables and offers “to do anything to get it.” If asked why, she tells them she wishes to return to the Casino.

## 11. Straw Doll Beacon
A toy straw doll sits upright in the path. If picked up, it “thanks” them and asks to be taken home. It then begins quietly attracting predators/henchmen as if it’s a beacon.

## 12. Lost Fairy Soldier: “Orders From the 5 Wings War”

A palm-sized fairy in a battered tin cuirass and a paper-plumed helmet drops from the canopy and lands in a perfect parade stance. They demand to know why the party is “off-route” and sheepishly asks for directions to the Floating Isles, insisting they must report back to **King Thistledart, Monarch of the Sprites**
on the status of the 5 Wings War immediately.

- If treated kindly, the fairy offers to introduce them to their King
- If mocked or threatened, they blow a tiny whistle and yells “arrest these deserters.”

## 13. The Orchard of Borrowed Smiles

A small orchard of pale fruit trees bears strange fruit shaped like smiling mouths. The smiles giggle when plucked.

- Eating one grants advantage on the next Charisma check in the next hour, but the eater’s face becomes expressionless for the same duration (disadvantage on Insight, or NPCs distrust them).
- The ground beneath the trees is littered with old masks and broken makeup kits.

## 14. The Quiet Where Sound Should Be (Spa Foreshadow)

The forest abruptly loses sound—no insects, no wind, no footsteps. Conversation comes out as a faint whisper no matter how loud you speak.

- After 1 minute, everyone makes a DC 13 Wis save. On a failure, they forget the last 10 minutes of travel (you can reposition them slightly, or tick your major encounter tracker forward).
- A success notices a faint, distant “melody” that seems to come from behind them no matter where they turn.

## 15. Casino Chip Rain
It begins to rain hot brass casino chips that hiss when they hit leaves. Each chip has a sin stamped on it (GREED, PRIDE, etc.). Collecting chips is tempting: each chip can be spent later at the casino as 1 gp or cashed for a minor boon (inspiration, advantage on one Charisma check)… but each chip carried imposes a cumulative -1 to Wisdom saves vs casino impulse (max -3) until a long rest.

## 16. Yarnspinner Story Weavers
A pack of Yarnspinner's story weavers find the party in the woods. They ask questions about who they are, what they are, what they do, all the while one of them fervently writes all that is being said. Once satisfied, they welcome the party to come visit Fablerise. 

The party begins to forget their names and backstories.

## 17. Skabatha’s “Kidnapper” (Dolgaunt)
Skabatha's “kidnapper” finds them in the woods. (1x Dolgaunt)

## 18. Mind-Worming Dark (Dex/Int)
The forest grows dark and worms itself into your mind. Disadvantage on Dex and Int checks; removed on long rest.

## 19. Somber Grey Fog (Str/Wis)
The forest grows somber and grey; likewise you feel a fog within your mind. Disadvantage on Str and Wis checks; removed on long rest.

## 20. Energy Sap (Con/Cha)
The forest seems to lean towards you; like vampires draining their prey of blood, you are sapped of energy. Disadvantage on Con and Cha checks; removed on long rest.

# Major Encounters
Every 6 overland actions a major encounter happens. Track this openly so the party knows something is about to happen.

1. Sir hippity of the hop, 35th of his name finds Sevro and challenges him to a duel to the death.
    - Chopaign will be watching first from Di's sword, then by opening a portal and watching in person.

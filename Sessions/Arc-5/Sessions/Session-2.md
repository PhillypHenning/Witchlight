## Recap
You escaped the Twilight Court, leaving behind its treacherous beauty and half-spoken bargains, only to be swallowed by an endless fog that leeched strength and memory alike. Just as the mist threatened to claim you entirely, a lone cottage emerged from the gray, Zylbina’s cottage, standing stubbornly where nothing else should. It was here, at the edge of the unknown, that Seren first crossed your path, revealing herself cautiously as the group tested trust in a land that had offered none so far.
Within the cottage, magic worked unattended: phantom hands stirred a bubbling cauldron, books turned their own pages, and unseen servants swept and sorted. Curiosity, and poor impulse control, led to sampling the stew, with unpleasant, numbing consequences. As tension mounted, the forest itself seemed to respond. The ground shook, trees bent aside, and a second cottage strode forth on enormous chicken legs. From it descended Baba Yaga, crooked and terrible, her presence smothering the air.
She spoke calmly, dangerously, and lingered long enough to remind you how small you were. In a brief but momentous exchange, Baba Yaga conversed with Endyln, their words cryptic and laden with power, as though pieces were being moved on a board far beyond your sight. Then, just as suddenly, the moment passed. The fog thinned. The path forward opened.
Leaving the cottage behind, you took your first true steps into Thither. The land announced itself immediately: towering, unnatural mushrooms rose from the forest floor, strange and unsettling, forcing caution with every step. Not long after, that caution proved wise when you were ambushed by shrieking sugar goblins, garish Fey creatures whose bright colors belied real danger. Steel and spellfire cut them down, leaving behind scorched bodies and absurd traces of candy amid the blood.
Bruised, rattled, but alive, you pressed on just far enough to make camp. As night settled over Thither, you tended wounds, counted losses, and stared into the fire with the shared understanding that the Feywild had finally opened its jaws. The Twilight Court was behind you now, and whatever watched from the trees ahead knew your scent.

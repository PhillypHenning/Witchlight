# Arc-5, Session-3

## Villain Cutscene: The Spa

*The scene opens on a wandering merchant trudging through the enchanted forest of Thither. His pack is heavy, his feet ache, and twilight is falling. Then he hears it—a strange, beautiful music drifting through the trees. Half lullaby, half funeral march. His exhaustion forgotten, he follows the sound.*

*Through the mist-shrouded trees, warm light beckons. The Never Leave Spa emerges from the fog: marble walls glistening with condensation, windows glowing invitingly, steam curling from chimneys into the twilight sky. The sign promises rest. Relaxation. Relief.*

*The merchant enters. Thick grey steam fills every corridor, every room. Shadowy figures move through the mist, gesturing welcomingly. The music grows louder, more beautiful, drowning out the small voice of doubt in the back of his mind.*

*"Right this way, sir," a voice says—or maybe he just imagines it.*

*He's led to a marble massage table. The stone is warm beneath him as he lies down. His eyes grow heavy. The music swells. Everything feels perfect, safe, like coming home after a long journey.*

*Somewhere above him, something large moves through the steam. Long, pale shapes glide past. The music intensifies.*

*The merchant sighs in deep relaxation, a blissful smile on his face.*

*Blood spatters across the marble walls.*

*The merchant continues to sigh contentedly as the scene fades to black.*

## Recap
After surviving the soul court where Sevro's afterlife was divided between Mr. Hat and Chopagne, and defeating the vengeful frog knight Kagg, the party departed the Witchlight Carnival with heavy knowledge weighing on them. They carry multiple burdens now: the seven missing carnival staff to find within a week, Dirlagraun's missing kitten Star somewhere in Thither's depths, and casino invitations that promise both fortune and danger.

As they traveled through the enchanted forest, they encountered Pin, a sprite with a broken leg caught in thistles. Karag's compassionate magic freed and healed the small creature, who flew off grateful to report back to King Thistle Dark. The mushroom fairy rings they discovered offered fast travel, but at a price—Jabberwocky excrement, which the chattering mushrooms wanted for their mysterious "experiments."

Now the party approaches the Starved Goblin Casino, smoke rising from its chimneys against the mountain slope near the floating islands. The invitations crinkle in their pockets, each one bearing their name and promising entry to a place where fortunes are won and lost, where carnival staff have gone missing, and where the owners wait with games that stake more than gold.

## Beats
1. Travel to Casino (Constitution checks, random encounter possibility)
2. [Starved Goblin Casino](../Starved-Goblin-Casino.md) - Arrival and Entry
   - **Security Check:** Goblin guard waves enchanted detection stone over each party member
   - **Di flagged:** Stone sounds when passed over Di (detects Chopaign's patronage)
   - Light interrogation by security, possible escalation to owners
3. Casino Floor - Games, NPCs, and Hidden Costs
4. Meeting Velisara & Caldrien (owners)
   - Potential private conversation with Di about Chopaign
   - May offer gift/favor in exchange for information on the Night Shade
5. Maurnu appearance
6. Finding Witchlight Staff (3 locations: public table, bathroom, high-roller room)

     - Has a small crowd of onlookers (including 2 imps and a tiefling) cheering her on
     - One of the Lesser Succubi (Lysara) is sitting nearby, encouraging her: "You're on such a roll, darling. Would be a shame to stop now..."
     - Her pixie dust is sparking erratically—sign of stress her intoxicated mind doesn't recognize
   - **Will she leave?** Persuasion DC 15, or prove house is cheating
     - If persuasion fails: "You're just jealous! I'm finally WINNING for once!"
     - If shown the house is manipulating her: Snaps out of it, horrified, immediately wants to leave

2. **Grimble "Grim" Swiftfoot** (Goblin, Snack Vendor) - Bathroom, locked in stall

     - "They're going to make me work it off. Down below. In the hot place. I heard what they do to people who can't pay..."
     - If party offers to help: "You can't pay my debt! It's too much! Unless... unless you can sneak me out?"
   - **Complication**: Kravik (floor security Bearded Devil) is actively searching the bathroom area
     - Party will need to either: pay his debt (23 starvens), create a distraction, or smuggle him out somehow

     - **If party approaches**: Shenax stops them—"High rollers only, unless you've got an invitation from management"
     - **If they get past**: Marlon barely recognizes them, eyes glazed: "Oh... you're from... wait, I'm in the middle of a game. Big game. Gonna win. Just watch..."
     - **If charm is broken** (Remove Curse, dispel magic, etc.): Marlon blinks, looks around in confusion and horror
       - "What... where am I? How long have I been...?" Sees his losses, goes pale: "Oh gods. Oh gods what have I done?"
       - Caldrien's smile vanishes, becomes cold: "Leaving so soon? With such a substantial debt?"
   - **Complication**: Even if charm is broken, Caldrien won't let him leave without paying the 89 starven debt or "making arrangements"

- **The Important Part**: At some point, leans in and quietly mentions the hagspawn want to speak to them
  - **Sharpens up noticeably after this**—drunk demeanor fades, becomes more serious and focused
- **Information**: Casino is neutral ground, agreements with all three hags, perfect for secret meetings
- **The Offer**: Tempest, Creak, and 3 want to meet properly to discuss alliance
  - "You help us kill the hags, we help you. Toyhouse location? We know it. Access to Yon? We can arrange it."
  - Meet at mushroom circle northwest of casino, one hour after party leaves

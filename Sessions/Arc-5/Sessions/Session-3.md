# Arc-5, Session-3

## Recap
After surviving the soul court where Sevro's afterlife was divided between Mr. Hat and Chopagne, and defeating the vengeful frog knight Kagg, the party departed the Witchlight Carnival with heavy knowledge weighing on them. They carry multiple burdens now: the seven missing carnival staff to find within a week, Dirlagraun's missing kitten Star somewhere in Thither's depths, and casino invitations that promise both fortune and danger.

As they traveled through the enchanted forest, they encountered Pin, a sprite with a broken leg caught in thistles. Karag's compassionate magic freed and healed the small creature, who flew off grateful to report back to King Thistle Dark. The mushroom fairy rings they discovered offered fast travel, but at a price—Jabberwocky excrement, which the chattering mushrooms wanted for their mysterious "experiments."

Now the party approaches the Starved Goblin Casino, smoke rising from its chimneys against the mountain slope near the floating islands. The invitations crinkle in their pockets, each one bearing their name and promising entry to a place where fortunes are won and lost, where carnival staff have gone missing, and where the owners—Velisara and Caldrien—wait with games that stake more than gold.

## Beats
1. Travel to Casino (Constitution checks, random encounter possibility)
2. [Starved Goblin Casino](../Starved-Goblin-Casino.md) - Arrival and Entry
3. Casino Floor - Games, NPCs, and Hidden Costs
4. Meeting Velisara & Caldrien (owners)
5. Maurnu appearance
6. Finding Witchlight Staff (3 locations: public table, bathroom, high-roller room)

## Reminders
### Casino Mechanics (CRITICAL)
- **Wisdom saves DC 12** every hour spent inside casino - failure adds hidden debuff stack
- **Currency**: Ability score points only (1 point = 10 starvens, must be positive scores)
- **VIP Voucher**: Grants 5 free starvens (one-time use per player)
- **Staff presence**: 3 Witchlight carnival workers inside (track locations)
- **Casino compulsion effect**: Increases impulsion to sin (represented by Wisdom saves)

### Casino Personnel
- **Velisara, Mistress of the Tables** (Succubus) - Owner, manages floor operations
- **Caldrien, Lord of the Loveden** (Incubus) - Owner, oversees high-roller rooms and "special services"
- **Security**: Bearded Devils (intimidating, efficient, lethal if provoked)
- **Table Hands**: Imps (deal cards, manage chips, quick and mischievous)
- **Escorts**: Lesser Incubi/Succubi (charm-focused, work the floor)
- **General Staff**: Imps (servers, cleaners, runners)
- **Head of Security**: [TBD - workshop during session]

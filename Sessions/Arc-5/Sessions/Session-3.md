# Arc-5, Session-3

## Villain Cutscene: The Spa

*The scene opens on a wandering merchant trudging through the enchanted forest of Thither. His pack is heavy, his feet ache, and twilight is falling. Then he hears it—a strange, beautiful music drifting through the trees. Half lullaby, half funeral march. His exhaustion forgotten, he follows the sound.*

*Through the mist-shrouded trees, warm light beckons. The Never Leave Spa emerges from the fog: marble walls glistening with condensation, windows glowing invitingly, steam curling from chimneys into the twilight sky. The sign promises rest. Relaxation. Relief.*

*The merchant enters. Thick grey steam fills every corridor, every room. Shadowy figures move through the mist, gesturing welcomingly. The music grows louder, more beautiful, drowning out the small voice of doubt in the back of his mind.*

*"Right this way, sir," a voice says—or maybe he just imagines it.*

*He's led to a marble massage table. The stone is warm beneath him as he lies down. His eyes grow heavy. The music swells. Everything feels perfect, safe, like coming home after a long journey.*

*Somewhere above him, something large moves through the steam. Long, pale shapes glide past. The music intensifies.*

*The merchant sighs in deep relaxation, a blissful smile on his face.*

*Blood spatters across the marble walls.*

*The merchant continues to sigh contentedly as the scene fades to black.*

## Recap
After surviving the soul court where Sevro's afterlife was divided between Mr. Hat and Chopagne, and defeating the vengeful frog knight Kagg, the party departed the Witchlight Carnival with heavy knowledge weighing on them. They carry multiple burdens now: the seven missing carnival staff to find within a week, Dirlagraun's missing kitten Star somewhere in Thither's depths, and casino invitations that promise both fortune and danger.

As they traveled through the enchanted forest, they encountered Pin, a sprite with a broken leg caught in thistles. Karag's compassionate magic freed and healed the small creature, who flew off grateful to report back to King Thistle Dark. The mushroom fairy rings they discovered offered fast travel, but at a price—Jabberwocky excrement, which the chattering mushrooms wanted for their mysterious "experiments."

Now the party approaches the Starved Goblin Casino, smoke rising from its chimneys against the mountain slope near the floating islands. The invitations crinkle in their pockets, each one bearing their name and promising entry to a place where fortunes are won and lost, where carnival staff have gone missing, and where the owners wait with games that stake more than gold.

## Beats

   - Light interrogation by security, possible escalation to owners
3. Casino Floor - Games, NPCs, and Hidden Costs
4. Meeting Velisara & Caldrien (owners)

5. Maurnu appearance
6. Finding Witchlight Staff (3 locations: public table, bathroom, high-roller room)

     - Has a small crowd of onlookers (including 2 imps and a tiefling) cheering her on
     - One of the Lesser Succubi (Lysara) is sitting nearby, encouraging her: "You're on such a roll, darling. Would be a shame to stop now..."
     - Her pixie dust is sparking erratically—sign of stress her intoxicated mind doesn't recognize
   - **Will she leave?** Persuasion DC 15, or prove house is cheating
     - If persuasion fails: "You're just jealous! I'm finally WINNING for once!"
     - If shown the house is manipulating her: Snaps out of it, horrified, immediately wants to leave

2. **Grimble "Grim" Swiftfoot** (Goblin, Snack Vendor) - Bathroom, locked in stall

   - Sacrificed: 3 points Intelligence (now 8, was 11), 2 points Wisdom (now 7, was 9)

     - If party offers to help: "You can't pay my debt! It's too much! Unless... unless you can sneak me out?"
   - **Complication**: Kravik (floor security Bearded Devil) is actively searching the bathroom area
     - Party will need to either: pay his debt (23 starvens), create a distraction, or smuggle him out somehow
   - **Will he leave?** Yes desperately, but scared of security

     - **If party approaches**: Shenax stops them—"High rollers only, unless you've got an invitation from management"
     - **If they get past**: Marlon barely recognizes them, eyes glazed: "Oh... you're from... wait, I'm in the middle of a game. Big game. Gonna win. Just watch..."
     - **If charm is broken** (Remove Curse, dispel magic, etc.): Marlon blinks, looks around in confusion and horror
       - "What... where am I? How long have I been...?" Sees his losses, goes pale: "Oh gods. Oh gods what have I done?"
       - Caldrien's smile vanishes, becomes cold: "Leaving so soon? With such a substantial debt?"
   - **Complication**: Even if charm is broken, Caldrien won't let him leave without paying the 89 starven debt or "making arrangements"
   - **Will he leave?** Insight DC 18 reveals magical compulsion; must break charm AND resolve debt

  - Mentions chaos in Downfall—frogs are more enraged and bloodthirsty than usual

- **The Warning** (PLAYERS hear this, CHARACTERS don't realize): "This place is cursed. Every hour you lose something internal—Wisdom, judgment, self-control. You don't notice. That's the trick. Get out before it's too late." Shows scars/tally marks: "Six hours before Tempest pulled me out."
- **The Important Part**: At some point, leans in and quietly mentions the hagspawn want to speak to them
  - **Sharpens up noticeably after this**—drunk demeanor fades, becomes more serious and focused
- **Information**: Casino is neutral ground, agreements with all three hags, perfect for secret meetings
- **The Offer**: Tempest, Creak, and 3 want to meet properly to discuss alliance
  - "You help us kill the hags, we help you. Toyhouse location? We know it. Access to Yon? We can arrange it."
  - Meet at mushroom circle northwest of casino, one hour after party leaves
  - Won't discuss details inside: "The walls listen. The floors remember. This place reports everything to the coven."

### Garvin Thornwell (Human Merchant)
Loud, drunk patron at Hellfire Blackjack, clearly in over his head

  - **Potential Deal**: Owners might offer minor gift/favor for information about the Night Shade
  - **Interrogation Scene**:
    - Owners will test Di's willingness to give up information on Chopaign
    - **Key Reveal**: "While you're within these walls, the casino nullifies any connection you have with your patron. He cannot see, hear, or sense you here. Neutral ground, remember?"
    - They'll gauge his loyalty—does he protect Chopaign's secrets or is he willing to share?

- General direction heading toward casino
- Constitution checks for movement (if applicable)

### Random Encounter #13 - The Orchard of Borrowed Smiles
- Yanaba rolled encounter
- Small orchard of pale fruit trees with strange fruit shaped like smiling mouths
- The smiles giggled when plucked
- **Yanaba fed fruit to Sevro**: Nothing happened
- **Yanaba fed fruit to Karag**: Made him laugh uncontrollably
  - Effect: Advantage on next Charisma check within 1 hour, but face becomes expressionless for same duration (disadvantage on Insight, NPCs distrust them)
- Ground beneath trees littered with old masks and broken makeup kits

### Random Encounter #6 - Raining Cats and Dogs

  - Took damage from falling animals

### Arrival at Starved Goblin Casino

  - Yanaba: Passed (second-to-last)

- Three party members entered main casino floor
- Thick atmosphere of smoke, music, laughter, and the clink of chips
- **Took positions at the bar** to survey the room
- Ordered drinks and began observing casino operations

### Caldrien's Approach
- **Caldrien (Incubus owner)** spotted them and approached with massive smile
- Walked directly toward Karag and Seren, ignoring Sevro completely
- Delivered signature line: **"Oh look a pious paladin come to get his prick pickled and a little modest monk following behind with aspirations of getting her muff melted. If you hurry upstairs now I bet you could get in on the waning orgy, perhaps even give it new fire."**
- **Karag refused**
- **Seren refused**
- **Sevro began saying he would join** but Caldrien completely ignored him
  - **New established trait**: Caldrien only interacts with "ugly" people if absolutely necessary; beautiful people don't interest him

### Velisara's Deal with Di
- **Velisara (Succubus owner)** entered security hallway
- **Yanaba**: Rolled through door and hid behind bush (remained hidden)
- Velisara approached Di with business proposition
- **Di asked for information about Chopaign**
- **Velisara offered trade**: Information for information
  - **What she wants**: Chopaign's true eye color
    - Truth is powerful in the Nine Hells
    - Information valuable but wouldn't arouse too much ire if discovered
  - **Terms**: Di must provide information within 2 months, or owe casino 100 starvens payable immediately
- **Di signed the agreement**
- **Velisara provided information about Chopaign**:
  - Where he resides
  - How powerful he is
  - Details about his domain and operations
- **CRITICAL OVERSIGHT**: Di never asked who Velisara and Caldrien's boss is
  - **(Future plot point)**: If Di asks Chopaign about his eye color, Chopaign will scold Di for his failure and task him with getting their boss's name
  - Chopaign may send his own investigator to find out—someone party could bump into

### Di Cleared and Enters
- Security cleared Di after Velisara's approval
- Di reunited with party on casino floor
- Yanaba emerged from hiding and followed

### Table Games

- **Heavy losses** for most party members
- Casino advantage clearly apparent
- Party experiencing the reality of "house always wins"

### Di Busts Out
- **Di lost all 20 starvens** of his initial buy-in
- Sitting at table, frustrated and empty-handed
- Ability score points gone
- **Caldrien noticed** and approached with interest

### Caldrien's Second Deal
- Caldrien offered Di **50 starvens** as a "loan"
- **In exchange**: Di must sign the same contract Velisara offered
  - Provide Chopaign's true eye color within 2 months
  - Or owe 100 starvens immediately
- **Di agreed and signed**
- **CRITICAL COMPLICATION**: Di now has TWO contracts requiring same information

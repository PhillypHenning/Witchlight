# Arc-5, Session-4

## Opening Cutscene: The Floating Isles

The camera starts low, half-buried in charred moss and ash at the forest floor. Silence—then a deafening groan of tortured metal screams from above. The shot rockets upward, racing along an iron chain as thick as an ancient oak: links pitted with rust and rage, scored with runes that weep red, climbing impossibly toward the sky. The camera spirals as it ascends, the forest becoming insignificant below, until five rocky islands tear into view—each one impaled through its heart by the chain, dangling like crucified worlds against the twilight.

The camera circles the war-torn ring in a relentless sweep. The first isle bristles with living fortifications: thorn-walls twenty feet high woven from blackened bramble, watch-towers built from dead wood and barbed wire, and behind them—*dragonfly wings*. Thousands of them. Humming like a swarm, their translucent shimmer catching firelight from burning arrow-tips. Tiny figures in bark-armor stand in perfect formations, bows drawn, faces carved from stone and fury. The second isle explodes with *color gone mad*—mushroom-towers wrapped in tattered silk banners, rope-bridges draped with bells that ring discordant warnings, and everywhere: glittering dust clouds that pulse like dying stars. Butterfly wings flash pink-teal-violet as figures dart through the haze, conjuring illusions of gardens that bloom and die in seconds, laughter that sounds like breaking glass. The third isle is a *war machine*—thimble-bunkers riveted together, catapults made from bottle-caps and wire, cogwheel-turrets spinning with mechanical fury. Wings made of copper shimmer and spark as six-inch engineers swarm over their creations, launching bolts of scrap metal across the void. Fire blooms where they strike. The fourth isle beats with *rhythm and defiance*—cricket-bodied figures stand on bark-platforms playing fiddles that shriek like dying things, their music weaponized into sonic assaults. Red war-banners snap in wind that shouldn't exist, and their legs—massive, chitinous, built for leaping—kick and stamp in unison like war drums made flesh.

The camera plunges toward the center. The fifth isle is *annihilation*. Scorched stone. Shattered toadstools the size of houses, their caps blown open like wounds. Burned petals that were once forests. Craters where magic detonated. And still they fight—tiny figures clashing in bursts of poison-green light, arrows whistling through conjured storms, music that shatters stone, machines that scream. Bodies fall into the mist below. The chain groans, iron bleeding rust like blood, holding them all together in their hatred. The camera lingers on a single fallen banner—trampled, burned, forgotten—before pulling back to show the full horror: five kingdoms tearing themselves apart, chained to their war, unable to stop, unable to leave. Smoke rises. The screen cuts to black.

## Recap
The Starved Goblin Casino welcomed you with warm lights and cold promises. Security stripped your weapons at the door, and when Di was flagged by their enchanted detection stone, the party split—some to the bar, others held back in tense negotiation. Velisara, the succubus owner draped in liquid gold, made Di an offer he couldn't refuse: information about Chopaign in exchange for the archdevil's true eye color. Di signed. Then, when his luck ran dry at the tables and his starvens turned to dust, Caldrien appeared with that perfect smile and offered fifty starvens—if Di would sign the same contract. Di signed again.

What Di doesn't know: Velisara and Caldrien work together. The contract isn't doubled—it's reinforced. They know exactly what they're doing. Yanaba watched the first deal from the shadows. The casino knows more than it should.

Meanwhile, Tilly Tumbleweed—one of the missing Witchlight staff—flies erratically around the Devil's Dice table, laughing too loud, winning too much, her pixie dust sparking with stress she doesn't recognize. She gave you starvens freely, generous in her intoxication, but shows no sign of wanting to leave. Two more staff members remain hidden somewhere in this den of beautiful devils and cruel games: Grimble the goblin, who gambled away everything, and "Lucky" Marlon, whose luck has long since run out.

The casino hums around you. Music wraps itself around your thoughts. Dealers smile with teeth too white. Every win feels hollow. Every loss feels inevitable. You came here to rescue the lost, but the longer you stay, the harder it becomes to remember why leaving matters at all.

The house always wins. The question is: what will it cost you to prove otherwise?

## Reminders

### Casino Mechanics (CRITICAL)
- **Wisdom saves DC 12** every hour spent inside casino - failure adds hidden debuff stack
- **Currency**: Ability score points only (1 point = 10 starvens, must be positive scores)
- **Time Tracking**: Party entered during Session 3 - track hours for Wisdom saves
- **Casino compulsion effect**: Increases with failed Wisdom saves

#### Current Starven Count (Start of Session 4)
- **Sevro**: ~100 initially, losses unknown
- **Yanaba**: 10 (from Tilly)
- **Di**: 30 (from Caldrien's deal, after losing initial 20)
- **Karag**: 10 (from Tilly)
- **Seren**: 5 (from Tilly)

#### Ability Scores Lost
- **Di**: Lost 20 points in initial buy-in (need to specify which stats)
- Track any additional losses from continued play

#### Wisdom Save Tracker (Hidden Debuff)
**Every hour in casino**: Wisdom save DC 12

**On Failure**: Add 1 stack of "Sinner's Weight"

**Effects per Stack** (cumulative):
1. Disadvantage on Insight checks
2. Disadvantage on Wisdom saves
3. -1 to all Wisdom-based skill checks
4. Compulsion to keep gambling (Wisdom save DC 15 to leave without "one more game")
5. Charmed by Velisara or Caldrien (can be broken with Lesser Restoration or leaving casino for 24 hours)

**Removal**: 
- Leave casino for 8+ hours: Remove 1 stack per 8 hours
- Lesser Restoration: Removes 2 stacks
- Greater Restoration: Removes all stacks

### Di's Contract with the Casino Owners
- **One contract, two signings** for Chopaign's true eye color
  - Velisara offered the deal first (witnessed by Yanaba while hidden)
  - Caldrien offered 50 starvens to sign the same contract (witnessed by party at tables)
  - **They work together**: This is coordinated, not a mistake
- **Terms**: Provide Chopaign's true eye color within 2 months OR owe 100 starvens immediately
- **What Di doesn't know**: He should have asked who the casino owners' boss is, or have gotten more information on the owners

#### When Di Asks Chopaign About His Eye Color:
- **Chopaign will catch on** to why Di is asking
- **Chopaign's response**: Scolds Di for his failure
  - "You made a deal with devils and didn't learn who they serve? Foolish."
  - Compares the casino owners' boss's power to his own (implies it's comparable or greater)
  - The comparison won't be obvious to Di—Chopaign's power level isn't clear to him
- **The carrot and stick**: Chopaign offers a counter-deal
  - Find out the casino owners' **boss's name** OR the owners' **true names**
  - Only then may Chopaign tell Di his eye color
  - This turns Di's problem into a quest for information about infernal hierarchies

### "White Bliss" Drug Mechanic
- **Not yet offered** to Sevro (should happen this session via escort)
- **Effect**: Extremely hard drug with sedation-like effects
- **Addiction Mechanic**: Each use requires DC 15 Constitution save

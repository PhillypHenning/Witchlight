# Return to the Witchlight Carnival (Thither Interlude)

## Opening: the forest gives way to canvas
The undergrowth thins into a trampled lane that smells of **sawdust, kettle-corn, and wet leaves**. Lantern-light glows ahead, too warm and too round to be natural. The trees part as if politely asked, revealing striped tents and wagons nestled in the forest like the carnival has always belonged here.

But something’s off in the way the lights behave: their colors are *too saturated*, as if the air itself is painted. Music drifts through the branches and then… rewinds half a bar, correcting itself. Time here doesn’t flow—it **performs**.

As the party approaches, they see new signage hammered into trees at the perimeter:

> **“WITCHLIGHT STAFF ONLY — STRICTLY ENFORCED.”**

And in smaller letters, like it was added later:

> **“NO EXCEPTIONS (unless funny).”**

# 1) The Welcome Gate: 3 bugbear guards (jokes get you in)
## Scene description
The Welcome Gate is the familiar arch of lights and painted moons—except now it’s been braced with rough-hewn logs like someone was worried it might be knocked over. Three bugbears in mismatched Witchlight vests stand watch. They have clipboards. None of them appear able to read what’s on them, but they hold them *very* seriously.

They look bored in the way predators look bored.

### The bugbears
- **Hogwick**: tries to sound official; uses big words incorrectly.
- **Marn**: loves jokes, laughs late, repeats punchlines.
- **Tulip**: suspicious of everything except slapstick; collects “fine” hats.

## Event: getting in
They’ve been told by Mr. Witch (Mr. White) to **not let non-staff in**. They will block the entry and demand:
- “Staff badge?”
- “Shift assignment?”
- “Secret staff greeting?”

### Ways in (pick what fits your table)
**A) Jokes (best route):**  
If the party tells a genuinely good joke, pun, bit, or prank:
- **Group check:** Performance or Persuasion DC 12.  
- Success: bugbears let them in and give them a ridiculous “temporary badge” (a sticker, a ribbon, a face stamp).  
- Fail: they still laugh, but demand a *second* joke “with props.”

**B) Paperwork bluff:**  
Forge/lie about being “new hires.”
- Deception DC 13 (advantage if they have any prior Witchlight tokens/props from earlier).
- On success, Hogwick “signs them in” with a crayon.

**C) Bribe (non-monetary works best):**  
They don’t care about gold much, but love:
- snacks, candy, shiny buttons, a silly hat, a fake mustache, a dramatic compliment.
- Persuasion DC 12, auto-success if the offering is tailored to a guard’s quirk.

**D) Force / intimidation:**  
Possible, but it changes the vibe of the whole return. If threatened, one bugbear runs to alert staff; the others stall. This puts Mr. Witch immediately on edge.

# 2) Skabatha sighting: she leaves as they enter
## Scene description
As the party is mid-entrance—badge being slapped on, an impossible **cackling** rolls across the carnival like thunder under velvet.

Overhead, between lantern strings, a **rocking horse** glides through the air as if the sky is a nursery floor. Astride it is a long-limbed figure with too much shadow under the chin and too little warmth in the eyes.

Skabatha doesn’t stop. She doesn’t need to.

She passes over the Welcome Gate like a bad omen made casual, then tilts upward and vanishes into the treeline and fog, leaving a faint scent of old wood shavings and scorched sugar.

## Event payload (what players can learn immediately)
- Any PC watching closely can make a **Perception DC 13**: they spot a small bundle under her arm (a toy, a book, or a struggling sack—your choice).  
- **Arcana DC 13**: the rocking horse’s flight leaves a lingering “thread” of magic pointing roughly toward the **Toyhouse / Loomlurch direction** for 1 minute.

This sighting is your clean reminder: *the carnival is here, but the coven is still moving pieces.*

# 3) Dirlagraun follows up with Yanaba (the kitten urgency)
## Scene description
Inside the gate, the carnival feels *almost* like relief, until the relief becomes pressure. Familiar attractions stand where they used to, but in Thither they look… defensive. Some tents are roped off. Some lanterns are dark. Staff smiles are thinner.

A sleek shape darts between wagons: a **displacer beast** with the grace of a dancer and the gaze of something that knows it’s being hunted.

Dirlagraun finds Yanaba like a magnet finds iron.

She pads close, head high, tail lashing, then her voice lands in Yanaba’s mind (or comes out soft and urgent, depending on how you’ve been running her):

> “You came back. Thank the moon you came back. Tell me, did you find her? My kitten? Did you find Star?”

She looks past Yanaba, scanning the party like she’s measuring time by heartbeats.

> “I can feel it. The carnival will leave soon. One week, maybe less. If we leave Thither again and he's still here… I don’t know if I’ll ever find her.”

## Event: how this becomes a hook (not just a reminder)
Dirlagraun can offer **one concrete lead** right now (choose one):
- She smelled her kitten’s “star-scent” near a **children-only place** (pointing at your Orphanage thread).

# 4) Mr. Witch & Mr. Light: missing staff, uneasy agreement, and a job
## Scene description
A familiar voice announces a performance that no one seems to be watching. A second voice laughs a fraction too late.

Mr. Light is still bright but the brightness is strained, like a smile held too long. Mr. Witch is still composed but his eyes keep tracking the perimeter as if expecting something to step out of the trees wearing a staff uniform.

They greet the party with relief that they try to hide.

> Mr. Light: “Well! Look who’s returned from the woods with all their limbs, how positively responsible of you.”
>
> Mr. Witch: “This is… unexpected. And inconvenient. But I won’t pretend I’m unhappy to see you.”

They don’t say “Hourglass Coven” out loud at first. When they do, it’s quiet.

> “We have an arrangement. We do not like it. But the carnival is… *tethered.*”

## Event: the request
Three staff members left the grounds and never returned. Mr. Witch has forbidden search parties, too risky, too visible, too likely to escalate the Doll's attention.

They ask the party to find and bring back **three missing carnies** before the carnival departs in **one week**.

### The missing three (ready-to-run)
1) **Perrin Quill** (ticket-taker / barker)  
   - Last seen: heading toward a fairy ring to “take a shortcut.”  
   - Quirk: compulsively narrates everything like it’s a show.  

2) **Sella Nibs** (seamstress / costume runner)  
   - Last seen: went after stolen fabric and never came back.  
   - Quirk: carries pins in her mouth; speaks around them.  

3) **Old Bramblejack** (groundskeeper / lantern-lighter)  
   - Last seen: went to relight a “dark patch” at the edge of camp.  
   - Quirk: claims he can hear when lanterns are lonely.  

### Timer (simple and visible)
Tell the players: **“7 nights until departure.”**  
Each long rest ticks it down. Each major detour might tick it down faster if you want pressure.

### Reward from Witch & Light (choose one or stack lightly)
- **Witchlight favor:** free entry, food, and safe long rest on carnival grounds.
- **Practical:** 1–2 healing potions + a “backstage pass” that grants advantage on social checks with Witchlight staff.
- **Information:** a map with a “safe-ish” trails marked (to one static place you want them to hit next).

# 5) Kettlesteam encounter: progress check + shared frustration
## Scene description
Near a staff-only wagon row, the party hears the sound of someone **arguing in a whisper**.

Kettlesteam is there, half-hidden under a hood, talking to two staff members who look like they’ve been awake too long. Her hands move as she speaks—sharp, precise gestures, like she’s trying to cut the truth out of the air.

When she spots the party, she stops mid-sentence. Her eyes flick over them: alive, armed, changed.

> “You’re still breathing. That puts you ahead of me.”

She exhales hard.

> “Tell me you’ve made progress. Tell me someone here has made progress.”

## Event: what she wants / what she offers
She asks directly:
- What have you learned about the coven?
- Have you seen Zybilna or signs of her?
- What’s your plan?

She admits her own attempts have not gone well:
- She tried to follow a lead, got turned around by Thither’s story-logic, and barely got back.
- She suspects the carnival is being used as cover (she doesn’t know details, but she *smells* the compromise).

### Give the party something actionable
Kettlesteam can offer one of these:
- A warning: “Someone is taking names. Not titles—*names.* If it happens, seek out Yarnspinner as soon as you can.”

### Optional tension beat (if you want)
Kettlesteam is wary of Sevro’s undead complication (if it’s still relevant). She doesn’t threaten, she just watches too carefully and asks one question too many.



# 6) Candlefoot’s Missing Verse
Candlefoot can’t remember a number of key verses, everyone swears the songs always had. He'd like the parties help to remember the verses.

Song 1:
    With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
    Try this trick and spin it, yeah (Brr)
    Your head will collapse, if there's nothing in it
    And you'll ask yourself

    Answer: Where is my mind?


Song 2: 
    We don't need no education
    We don't need no thought control
    No dark sarcasm in the classroom
    _something something_
    We're just another brick in the wall

    Answer: Hey, teather! Leave those kids alone.

Song 3:
    Last thing I remember, I was
    Running for the door
    I had to find the passage back
    To the place I was before
    "Relax," said the night man
    "We are programmed to receive
    You can check out any time you like
    
    Answer: But you can never leave"


Reward: The performer gifts the party a charm, the wearer can reroll one failed Performance/Persuasion check per long-rest.


# 7) The Half-Closed Attraction: Hall of Illusions Malfunction
One attraction is roped off with a sign: “TEMPORARILY UNSAFE (DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT YOURSELF)”. Inside, mirrors sometimes reflect the viewer as a child, sometimes as a stranger, but always with a name written across their forehead that isn’t theirs.

What it does: foreshadows your name-loss arc and gives the bard/warlock a playground.
Mini challenge: Arcana/Investigation DC 13 to stabilize the mirrors for the night.

Reward: The player who fixes the mirrors has their own name magically imprinted on their own forehead (negate the Yarnspinner story-thread)

# 8) Hurt Pixie
A bandaged Pixie adorned in militant armor flys toward you on unsteady wings. "I have to get back to the battlefield. King Glimmersip needs me.." His face is stone, a 100-yeard stare.

- The small pixie's name is Butterkiss. While on a raid in the warlands the small Pixie was spiked like a volley-ball, shot off course and high and far into Thither's forest. He found the Witchlight Carnival.. or rather they found him and bandaged him up. Butterkiss snuck away while the Doctor wasn't looking.
- Tell them he cannot offer them a reward but can bring them to his king who would have the means

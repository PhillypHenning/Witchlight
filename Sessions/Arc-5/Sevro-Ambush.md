# Sevro's Ambush
## Beats
1. They hear the frog knight announce his intent to kill Sevro
2. Chopaign enters through a portal to watch Sevro's last moments


From somewhere off in the distance a throaty voice can be heard.

"THIEF KING SEVRO. _Ribbit_. I have finally found you. 120 cycles have passed since you stole the crown from my people, the good tadpoles of Downfall. You murdered our king and set the sunken court to chaos. _ribbit_. BUT TODAY, THAT ENDS."

A knight in shining armor emerges from the treeline, a gaggle of frog-like humanoids following behind it carrying different items and flags in their hands, murmuring to one another.

"THIEF KING SEVRO. _Ribbit_. I CHALLENGE YOU! TODAY WILL BE YOUR END, TODAY WILL BE THE DAY THE CROWN IS RETURNED TO MY PEOPLE. TODAY WILL BE THE DAY I BECOME THE KING OF DOWNFALL."

Di, the sword at your hip is red hot. You glance down quickly, a familiar eye sits in the middle of the hilt glaring towards the scene unfolding infront of you.

---

Screams begin filling the air as a red portal springs to life beside you. The magic swirls within it, and through it you can see a hellscape. Two large red, brown hands emerge grabbing the sides of the portal and stretching it open further. From it, Chopaign emerges with a chuckle.

"It's been a long while since I left Avernus, but to watch Sevro die, ha ha, I couldn't miss that now could I."

Chopaign: "Di. You became my follower in exchange for the soul of Sevro.. I personally hate the man and couldn't wait to add his poor little whines and wails to my colleciton. But I put that aside. Do you know why I did that?"

"Because I realized I had a means of getting the wails and whines of more than just Sevro. Your friend is dying in front of you now, so tragic, you must feel awful. But do you know the irony of it all Di?"

"The irony Di is that before you were my follower you were a cleric of Gond and had you kept being a cleric of Gond you would have the power in this moment to save Sevro's soul. I of course could save him and I could offer that power to you but I won't be doing that. I'm happy to take this little worm's soul, but take sollace in the fact that one day, your soul's wails will be reunited with him."

## Sir Hip Toadstoll
- Regular Bullywug from a stats perspective
- Has a silver sword that the Bullywog people have put their trust in called "KingSlayer"
    - Normal long sword for stats
    - If attacking Sevro, it automatically crits and the number of dice is tripled (then doubled)

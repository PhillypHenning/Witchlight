## Molt
Thither’s path narrows into a corridor of leaning trees and soft fungus-light. The air tastes like paper left too long in a damp cellar. Threads of webbing catch on your clothes, not sticky, more like impatient fingers tugging you forward.

Then the forest opens onto something that makes your stomach drop.

A **molt** lies half-buried in ferns and rotting leaves: a shed skin the size of a cottage, shaped like a spider but too large to comfortably fit in your mind. Its legs arc like collapsed rafters. The hollow “skull” is split open where something far bigger climbed out of itself.

Inside the husk, **small insects feast**—beetles and pale centipedes swarming over the inner seams like priests at an altar. Every so often, the husk flexes in the breeze and the sound is not leaf-rustle; it’s the whisper of turning pages.

And beneath it, tied to the underside with careful knots of silk, hangs a small **satchel**.

## Fablerise — Intro Description (read-aloud)
Far ahead, through the trees, you can see a silhouette: a **massive hollow tree**, its trunk carved into balconies and windows like a vertical city. Lanterns glow in its bark. Webbing spans from branch to branch like bridges. A sign swings over a natural archway in the wood:

**FABLERISE**

# Adventure Summary (Fablerise in 5 acts)
**Tone:** storybook wonder + editorial cruelty. Social and combat both matter; violence draws attention fast.

### Act I — The Molt (Warning + Optional Fight + Bargaining Chip)
- The molt telegraphs: *Yarnspinner is not a fight right now.*
- Optional combat: the scavenging insects (low-risk, resource-tax fight).
- Reward: the **satchel-book**, useful as admission or leverage later.

### Act II — Arrival at Fablerise (The Theater Outside)
- The outer “front door” is an **open-air theater** built into roots and platforms.
- One of Yarnspinner’s daughters cheerfully advertises a show “later today,” and casually confirms that **stories are harvested here**.

### Act III — Entry Toll (Bring a Book)
- The main entrance requires the party to “pay” with **a good book** (or equivalent value).
- Clever alternatives are possible (performance, trade a memory, offer an unfinished story, etc.), but each has consequences.

### Act IV — Descent Through the Trunk (Web-Walls + Editors)
- Inside, Fablerise drops downward like a well.
- Webbing walls are made for spiders, not humanoids.
- “Editors” (daughters) confront the party: they try to web them up and eject them before escalating to a larger response.

### Act V — The Library + Silksong’s Bargain (3 stories to finish)
- Deep library: living catalogues, whispering shelves, and names stored as narrative components.
- Silksong (major daughter) recognizes the party’s problem and offers a deal: **finish 3 stuck stories**, get names back.
- Stories: **Little Red Riding Hood**, **Hansel & Gretel**, and **Skin Granny** (a “final draft” boss encounter).

# Act I — The Molt

## Optional combat: scavengers in the husk
**What it looks like:** dozens of small bodies moving in coordinated hunger, crawling in and out of seams like punctuation marks.

**Combat suggestions (pick one):**
- 2–3 **Swarms of Insects** (MM) + 1 **Giant Centipede** “overseer”
- or 1 **Swarm of Rot Grubs**-style hazard (if you like body-horror, use carefully)

**Twist:** If combat turns loud, the webbing in nearby trees subtly tightens—Fablerise “notices.”

## The satchel-book reward (bargaining chip)
Under the molt is a silk-knotted satchel containing a thin hardback:

**“MARGIN NOTES FROM A MOTHER”** (or any title you like).  
Inside are corrections written in a spidery hand, brutal, brilliant, and personal.

**Mechanical use (choose one):**
- **Admission:** counts as a “good book” for entry.
- **Leverage:** advantage on the first Persuasion/Deception check with any Editor or with Silksong.
- **Secret:** contains a true detail about Yarnspinner’s weakness/goal (not combat weakness—social leverage, e.g., “she hates unfinished endings”).

---

# Act II — Fablerise Exterior + Theater

## Theater scene (read-aloud)
Built into the roots is a small amphitheater: benches carved from fungus-bloated logs, a stage of woven silk stretched tight like a drum. Above it hangs a curtain that looks like lace until you realize it’s webbing layered in hundreds of overlapping patterns.

A spider tenatively steps onto the stage and bows as if you’re already applauding.

> “Visitors! Readers! Would-be characters!”  
> “A show tonight, tragedy, comedy, a moral lesson you will definitely ignore!”

If asked what the show is: she answers lightly, “A tale about *people who tried to leave a story before it was done*.”

### Theater daughter NPC (quick)
**Playbill** (Yarnspinner daughter, hype-person)  
- Friendly, enthusiastic, completely unbothered by fear.
- If the party seems interesting, she hints: “If you go inside without paying, the Editors will *restructure you*.”

---

# Act III — Entry Toll (Give a Book)

## The rule
At the main opening in the tree, webbing forms an archway with a sign:

**“ONE GOOD BOOK PER VISIT.”**

A living “book cradle” (web hammock) waits to receive it.

### What counts as “good”
- A real book with a complete narrative (best).
- A personal journal is “acceptable but tacky.”
- The satchel-book from the molt is *excellent*.

## If they don’t want to give up a book (clever solutions)
Give them 3–4 options so it feels fair:

1) **Tell a story at the theater** (bard spotlight)  
   - Performance DC 13. Success: they’re granted entry as “featured talent.”  
   - Failure: they may still enter, but an Editor follows to “revise” them later.

2) **Trade a secret / a memory** (warlock bargain energy)  
   - The web “drinks” one memory: the PC forgets a minor detail (your choice with consent).  
   - This is thematically perfect if you’re building toward name loss.

3) **Sneak in backstage** (ranger spotlight)  
   - Stealth DC 14. On success: entry, but now they’re trespassers.  
   - On failure: Editors arrive immediately (Act IV starts hot).

4) **Force** (paladin/barb option)  
   - Works, but it escalates the whole place. Fablerise becomes hostile quickly.

# Act IV — The Descent + Editors (low-combat engagement)

## The trunk interior (read-aloud)
Inside is not a room; it’s a vertical throat. The hollow trunk descends into darkness, and the walls are layered in web—thick enough to walk on if you were made for it. Threads hum faintly like harp strings.

There are no stairs. Only silk.

Somewhere below, you hear pages turning by themselves.

## Getting down (let them be clever)
Offer obvious methods and reward creativity:
- **Climb down webbing:** Athletics DC 13 (with gloves/gear advantage). Fail = slip, lose progress, minor fall damage (or catch a strand).
- **Make a silk “elevator”:** Tools/Survival/Arcana DC 13 to rig a descent line.
- **Magic:** feather fall, spider climb, misty step, etc. trivializes parts (that’s okay).

## The Editors approach
Two or three spider-fey drop onto the web-wall around them without making a sound—like punctuation appearing mid-sentence.

They carry quills made of bone and thread, and speak like irritated librarians.

> “Unauthorized characters.”  
> “This chapter is closed.”  
> “Return to the margins.”

### Their goal
They don’t want a fair fight. They want to:
- **restrain** the party to the web-wall,
- tag them with silk “corrections,”
- and push them back toward the exit.

### Running it (low-combat, high tension)
Treat it as a 3–round engagement:
- Editors use webbing attacks to restrain (nonlethal).
- PCs can talk them down:
  - Persuasion/Deception DC 14 if offering a valuable book or the molt-book.
  - Performance DC 13 if the bard frames themselves as “scheduled entertainment.”
- If PCs start killing Editors, the Editors **retreat** after 1–2 rounds to fetch “Reviewers” (a bigger, nastier encounter you can drop later).

# Act V — The Library + Silksong’s Deal

## Library reveal (read-aloud)
The descent opens into a vast hollow chamber where the tree’s heart should be. Shelves spiral around the inside like ribs, stacked with books that breathe and whisper. Web-bridges span impossible gaps. Lanterns made from trapped dew-light float between aisles, illuminating titles that rearrange themselves when you aren’t looking.

You realize with a cold certainty that some books are not written in ink.

Some are written in **people**.

A figure waits on a central dais: taller, composed, draped in layered silk like formal robes. Their movements are calm, precise, and disappointed the way a professional critic is disappointed.

The large blue, white spider sits at a desk, a collection of books spread infront of it. Its two front legs seem to be leafing through the books and you can hear a quiet chittering coming from it that ocelates between calm and agiatated.

If the players make themselves known:
> “Oh you're Yarnspinner's newest characters! Welcome welcome. My name is Silksong, I am responsible for ... the stories Yarnspinner loses track of.”

The hook:
> "Perhaps we can help each other. I have a few stories that need an end and I can't figure out how best to end them. If you help me find these few stories endings, I will return your names and stories! Don't worry Yarnspinner has already put your stories aside for others, he'll never notice."

### Silksong (major daughter)
- Polite, predatory, bureaucratic.
- Views reality as editable text.
- Wants three stories “ended properly” because incomplete stories tangle the library and create dangerous narrative knots.

## The bargain
Silksong offers:
- Restore the party’s names (or lead them to where the names are stored), **if** the party resolves 3 stuck stories:
  1) **Little Red Riding Hood**
  2) **Hansel & Gretel**
  3) **Skin Granny** (Minor Hag) — “the draft that bites back”

If they refuse:
- Silksong doesn’t attack immediately; instead they threaten to “revise” the party’s roles in Thither (a curse like disadvantage on identity/social checks, or names slipping faster).

# The Three Stories (structure you can reuse)
Each story is a **book-portal**. When pulled in:
- The PCs gain “roles” (optional but fun): Hunter, Child, Stranger, Wolf, Witch, etc.
- The world enforces story logic: shortcuts, repeated phrases, and “scene transitions.”
- **Win condition:** end the story decisively (not necessarily “the classic ending,” but a coherent ending).
- **Failure condition:** story loops or “rewrites” a PC (temporary debuff, memory tax, or lost gear until they escape).

## 1) Little Red Riding Hood (social + paranoia + ambush)
**Core drama:** trust, deception, predator wearing a face.

**Scenes:**
- The path and the basket (temptation to stray).
- The cottage conversation (social checks, sussing out the lie).
- The reveal and rescue (combat or clever trap).

**Spotlights:**
- Bard: Performance/Insight to control the “tone” of the scene.
- Ranger: tracking and noticing inconsistencies.
- Warlock: social manipulation or warding charm.
- Paladin/barb: final confrontation / protection.

**Ending options (all valid):**
- Expose the “wolf” with proof (Insight-based).
- Negotiate a nonviolent ending (fey bargain).
- Kill/drive off the predator.

## 2) Hansel & Gretel (resource + navigation + trap-house)
**Core drama:** abandonment, hunger, baited comfort.

**Scenes:**
- Running out of supplies (forced choice).
- Breadcrumb logic failing (story “eats” the trail).
- The candy house (trap, temptation).
- Oven climax (classic or subverted).

**Spotlights:**
- Ranger: navigation / survival / noticing false trails.
- Bard: distracting the witch, rallying frightened “children.”
- Warlock: seeing through charm magic.
- Paladin/barb: brute forcing the “house” defenses.

**Ending options:**
- Destroy the house’s enchantment.
- Trick the witch into her own trap.
- Rescue captives and escape with proof.

## 3) Skin Granny (Minor Hag boss fight — “the story that fights back”)
**Core drama:** the editor’s nightmare made flesh; a “final draft” that refuses deletion.

**Setup:** Silksong admits this one isn’t a normal fairy tale. It’s a knot: something Yarnspinner tried to write, and it started writing itself.

**Arena:** a nursery-meets-printshop: pages nailed to walls, skin-thin parchment curtains, rocking chair that rocks on its own, ink that looks too dark.

**Boss identity:** “Skin Granny” appears kindly at first—offering a moral lesson—then sheds it like paper.

**Boss mechanics ideas (easy to run at level 4):**
- **Illusion/Disguise** to appear as a helpful grandmother.
- **Charm/Fear** pulses when she “reads” them aloud.
- **Minions:** paper-dolls / stitched toys / crawling manuscripts.
- **Weakness:** if the PCs speak/write a “true ending line” (a declaration like *“This story is over.”*) the room’s magic weakens for 1 round (advantage on attacks / saves).

**Ending:** defeating her creates a tangible “ending seal” Silksong needs.

---

## Rewards & Outcomes (recommended)
If the party completes all three:
- Silksong returns their **names** (or gives the location/access to retrieve them).
- Silksong grants a **Library Favor**: once, they can ask Fablerise for a true answer about a person/place in Thither (limited, but powerful).
- They keep the bargaining book (if they didn’t spend it) or trade it for another boon (scroll, charm, etc.).

If they cause a massacre / burn shelves / attack staff:
- Fablerise becomes an ongoing antagonist: Editors and Reviewers appear more often in your random encounters, and “name loss” accelerates.

If you want, I can next write:
1) Silksong’s exact dialogue beats (short, usable at the table),  
2) a compact “Editor” stat template appropriate for level 4 (nonlethal web focus), and  
3) one-page outlines for each story with 3–4 encounters each (including DCs and what counts as a “coherent ending”).

# Cinder Hold Prison

## Overview
A prison complex where Skabatha Nightshade keeps prisoners, particularly Harengon (Yanaba's birth parents among them). The prison serves as both a holding facility and a source of "materials" for Skabatha's toymaking endeavors.

## Location
[TBD - Somewhere in Thither, likely near the Toyhouse or in a remote area]

## Purpose
- Imprison those who displease Skabatha
- Hold "raw materials" for the Toyhouse
- Store potential "children" for Little Treats Orphanage
- **Primary current inmates**: Harengon, including Yanaba's birth parents

## Yanaba's Connection

### Background
- Yanaba was swapped at birth by cruel pixies (Feylost background)
- Her birth parents are alive and imprisoned in Cinder Hold
- Skabatha knows about Yanaba and wants to "complete the family"
- The kidnappers in the 4-Way Ambush are trying to bring her here

### The Family
- **Yanaba's birth parents**: [Names TBD]
  - Harengon, captured by Skabatha years ago
  - May not know their daughter survived the pixie swap
  - Held in Cinder Hold since before Yanaba's memories begin
  - Possibly intended for transformation into toys or servitude

## Structure & Defenses
[TBD - To be developed based on when party approaches]

### Possible Features:
- Built into hillside or underground
- Cages made of iron and brambles
- Guards: Animated toys, dolgaunts, or other Skabatha servants
- Magic wards preventing teleportation/escape
- Cold and damp atmosphere
- Echoes of crying and despair

## Inmates
1. **Harengon prisoners** (including Yanaba's parents)
   - Multiple families
   - Various stages of despair
   - Some may be "broken" and loyal to Skabatha now
   - Others planning escape or resistance

2. **Other Fey creatures**
   - Those who defied Skabatha
   - Failed servants
   - Competitors from other courts

3. **Children** (potential)
   - Awaiting transfer to Little Treats Orphanage
   - Too old or too rebellious for the orphanage
   - [Consider carefully - dark theme]

## Connection to Skabatha's Operations

### The Toyhouse Pipeline
- Prisoners may be transformed into toys
- Parts harvested for puppet-making
- Forced labor creating Skabatha's creations
- "Good behavior" means transfer to the Toyhouse (not necessarily better)

### Little Treats Orphanage
- "Suitable" children transferred there
- Families kept here to ensure obedience
- Threat of prison keeps orphans compliant

## Hooks & Quests

### Rescue Mission
- If Yanaba is captured, party must break her out
- Even if not captured, learning about her parents creates urgency
- Other prisoners could be rescued for allies/information

### Information Gathering
- Prisoners know about Skabatha's operations
- May have information about the Toyhouse location
- Could reveal weaknesses in Skabatha's domain

### Moral Dilemma
- Can't save everyone
- Who to rescue first?
- Some prisoners might be too broken to save
- Rescue attempt might endanger those left behind

## Key NPCs

### Warden [TBD]
- Skabatha's trusted servant
- Cruel but efficient
- [Stats and description to be determined]

### Yanaba's Birth Parents
- **Names**: [TBD]
- **Personality**: [TBD based on how dark/hopeful you want their situation]
- **Knowledge**: 
  - They may know about the pixie swap
  - Information about Skabatha's plans
  - Details about other Harengon prisoners
  - Possible knowledge of Toyhouse location

### Other Notable Prisoners
- [TBD - Could include plot-relevant NPCs or quest-givers]

## Escape Difficulty
- **High security**: Skabatha doesn't want her resources escaping
- **Magical wards**: Prevent simple teleportation solutions
- **Multiple guards**: Can't just fight through
- **Stealth or cleverness required**: Brute force likely to fail
- **Time pressure**: If Yanaba captured, Skabatha may move her quickly

## Complications
- **Alarm system**: Guards alerted quickly
- **Hostage situation**: Guards threaten other prisoners
- **Skabatha's attention**: She may come personally if there's a major incident
- **Pursuit**: Escaped prisoners are hunted
- **Guilt**: Can't save everyone, must leave some behind

## Loot & Rewards
- **Prisoners' gratitude**: Future allies in Thither
- **Information**: About Skabatha, the Toyhouse, and Thither
- **Key/Map**: To other Skabatha facilities
- **Skabatha's notes**: Revealing her plans
- **Magic items**: Confiscated from prisoners

## Aftermath
- **If successful rescue**: Made an enemy of Skabatha (if not already)
- **If Yanaba captured and not rescued**: Long-term quest, darker timeline
- **If prisoners freed**: Potential allies, but also refugees needing protection
- **Skabatha's response**: Increased security, hunting parties, retaliation

## Atmosphere & Themes
- **Despair**: Many prisoners have lost hope
- **Family**: Separation and longing to reunite
- **Identity**: Yanaba confronting her birth parents vs. adoptive family
- **Choice**: Who to save when you can't save everyone
- **Rebellion**: Some prisoners may fight back during rescue

## DM Notes
- This location should feel oppressive and dangerous
- Consider party level before having them infiltrate
- Could be endgame location for Skabatha's arc
- Yanaba's player (Emily) should have agency in how this unfolds
- Option: Parents could be rescued without Yanaba being captured first
- Balance darkness with hope—this is still D&D, not grimdark
- Consider whether parents are quest-givers or need rescuing themselves

## Future Development
- Map of prison complex
- Guard stat blocks
- Specific prisoner NPCs with names and stories
- Skabatha's orders/notes found in prison
- Escape routes and secret passages
- Timing: When do kidnappers try to take Yanaba here?

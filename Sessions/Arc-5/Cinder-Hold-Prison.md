# Cinder Hold Prison (Sindrhald)

## Overview
A prison complex where Skabatha Nightshade keeps prisoners, particularly Harengon. The prison is the corrupted remains of Prismeer's world tree, transformed into a burning, iron-filled hell that roams the northeastern countryside of Thither.

## Origin & Transformation

### Yggmir the Ancient - The World Tree
- **Yggmir the Ancient**: Prismeer's massive world tree, a colossal treant that was the heart of the domain
- Once home to all the Harengon, who lived together in harmony within its branches
- Sacred place, neutral ground, symbol of Prismeer's unity

### Endelyn's Corruption
- When **Endelyn Moongrave** took over Thither, she corrupted Yggmir
- The corruption twisted the treant from life-giver to prison-keeper
- Ancient magic warped into dark sorcery

### The Fracturing
- When Prismeer was fractured into three realms (Hither, Thither, Yon), Yggmir was **split in two**
- **One half**: Lies dead in Hither, a massive rotting corpse
- **Other half**: Survived in Thither but corrupted beyond recognition

### Skabatha's Transformation
- Skabatha Nightshade claimed the corrupted half of Yggmir
- Set it ablaze with **witchfire** (magical flames that burn but never consume)
- **Boarded up all the windows** with iron and thorns
- **Filled the interior with iron** (cold iron weakens fey, causes pain)
- Renamed it **Cinder Hold** (Old Norse: *Sindrhald* - "Cinder Dwelling/Hall")

### The Treant's New Purpose
- Yggmir is alive but corrupted, no longer benevolent
- **The prison itself IS the jailer** - no wardens or guards needed
- **Crushes anyone who attempts to approach without permission**
- **Crushes any prisoner who tries to escape**
- Branches and roots shift like limbs, striking with devastating force
- May still have fragments of its old consciousness, buried deep
- Trapped and enslaved by Skabatha's magic
- Completely autonomous - Skabatha need not be present

## Location & Movement
**Roams the northeastern countryside of Thither**
- Not stationary - the massive burning treant walks
- Trails of scorched earth and broken forest mark its passage
- Visible from great distances at night (witchfire glow)
- Prisoners trapped inside experience constant motion
- Skabatha can summon it or direct its wandering
- Difficult to track or predict location
- Sometimes stops for days, sometimes moves for miles

## Purpose
- Imprison those who displease Skabatha
- Hold "raw materials" for the Toyhouse
- Store potential "children" for Little Treats Orphanage
- **Harengon breeding program**: Force Harengon to breed constantly to produce more slaves/materials
- The Harengon were the prison's **first victims** when Yggmir was split (they already lived there)
- More prisoners added over time for various offenses against Skabatha

## The Harengon Breeding Program

### Skabatha's Purpose
- Harengon are valuable: fast-breeding, useful for labor, toy materials, and orphanage stock
- Constant breeding ensures steady supply

### Enforcement
- Harengon **forced to breed constantly**
- If they become unwilling or resistant, **Caldrien and Velisara pay a visit**
  - **Caldrien**: Lesser Incubus, casino co-owner, uses charm and coercion
  - **Velisara**: Lesser Succubus, casino co-owner, uses seduction and threats
  - Both are fiends in Skabatha's service (though they run the casino semi-independently)
- The threat of their visits keeps most prisoners compliant
- Those who resist too much disappear (transformed into toys, killed, or worse)

## The Weekly Sacrifice

### The Ritual
**Every week**, the Harengon prisoners must select one of their own for sacrifice.

**The Process:**
1. Prisoners must choose someone by the appointed day
2. **The Kidnappers** (dolgaunts or Skabatha's creatures) arrive to collect
3. Sometimes **others come to witness/participate**: Caldrien, Velisara, other Skabatha servants, or curious fiends
4. The selected Harengon is brought to **an open slab in front of all the cages**
5. The victim is **brutally killed** in full view of the other prisoners
6. The body is **chopped up and placed into a bag**
7. The kidnappers leave with the remains

**The Purpose:**
- **Harengon are the primary food source for all creatures of Thither**
- This keeps Skabatha's servants, beasts, and allies fed
- The public nature breaks the prisoners' spirits
- Forces complicity—they must choose who dies
- Creates infighting, distrust, and despair

**What Happens If They Refuse:**
- Skabatha's servants select multiple prisoners at random
- The breeding program is threatened
- Extra "punishments" are inflicted on the population
- No one has successfully refused in years

## Harengon Prison Politics

### The Old System (Until 2 Weeks Ago)
**The Council:**
- Composed of older Harengon who claimed wisdom and experience
- Governed the prison population and managed daily life
- Controlled the selection process for weekly sacrifices

**The Selection System:**
- Presented as **anonymous voting** by all prisoners
- Claimed to be fair and democratic
- **Secret truth**: The Council rigged every vote
- They manipulated results to ensure younger, healthier Harengon were sacrificed
- Protected the elderly and themselves
- No one outside the Council knew about the rigging

**Why It Worked:**
- Prisoners believed the system was fair (tragic luck)
- Younger Harengon kept dying, weakening resistance
- Council maintained control through perceived legitimacy
- Despair kept population compliant

### The Coup (2 Weeks Ago)
**The Separatists:**
- Young Harengon workers, healthy and strong
- Fed up with watching their generation be sacrificed
- Noticed the pattern: always the young, rarely the old
- **Did NOT know the voting was rigged** (at time of coup)
- Believed the system itself was flawed, not corrupt

**What Happened:**
- Separatists organized secretly
- Rose up and **overthrew the Council**
- **Jailed the older population** in separate cells
- Took control of the prison government
- Began **sacrificing the elderly** instead

**Current Status (2 sacrifices later):**
- Two elderly Harengon have been sacrificed
- The separatists believe they're being fair: "The old had their time"
- **Still don't know the voting was rigged** by the Council
- Some separatists starting to question if this is right
- The jailed elderly are furious and terrified

### When Yanaba Arrives

**The Scene:**
- Prison population is **split and in chaos**
- Bitter arguments between different factions
- **An old Harengon screaming at a younger one**:
  - *"You're killing us by choice! This isn't the way!"*
  - *"We led you, we protected you, and this is how you repay us?"*
  - *"You've become the monsters! No better than them!"*
- Young separatist shouting back:
  - *"Protected us?! We've been dying for years!"*
  - *"Every week, one of us! While you grew old and safe!"*
  - *"Now it's your turn to sacrifice!"*

**The Factions:**
1. **Separatist Leadership** (young, in control, conflicted)
2. **Separatist Hardliners** (young, believe elderly deserve this)
3. **Moderates** (young and old, think this has gone too far)
4. **The Jailed Council** (elderly, imprisoned, desperate)
5. **Council Loyalists** (elderly, angry at coup)
6. **The Broken** (all ages, given up, don't care anymore)

**Potential Discovery:**
- Evidence of the rigged voting might still exist
- Council members might confess to save themselves
- If revealed, changes everything: both sides were wrong
- Creates opportunity for unity or deeper division

## Structure & Defenses

**The Prison IS the Guardian:**
- **No warden, no jailers, no guards** - Cinder Hold itself is the jailer
- Yggmir's corrupted consciousness monitors all prisoners
- Branches and roots shift through interior spaces
- Anyone attempting to approach without Skabatha's permission is **crushed**
- Anyone attempting to escape is **crushed**
- The treant moves with terrifying speed despite its size
- Iron-reinforced wood is nearly impenetrable

### Interior Features:
- Cages made of iron and brambles built into the tree's interior
- Witchfire provides light (burns but doesn't consume)
- Cold iron everywhere - agonizing for fey prisoners
- Constant creaking and groaning as the tree walks
- Magic wards preventing teleportation/escape
- Echoes of crying and despair
- No guards needed - the prison itself watches

## Inmates
1. **Harengon prisoners** (including Yanaba's parents)
   - Multiple families
   - Various stages of despair
   - Some may be "broken" and loyal to Skabatha now
   - Others planning escape or resistance

2. **Other Fey creatures**
   - Those who defied Skabatha
   - Failed servants
   - Competitors from other courts

3. **Children** (potential)
   - Awaiting transfer to Little Treats Orphanage
   - Too old or too rebellious for the orphanage
   - [Consider carefully - dark theme]

## Connection to Skabatha's Operations

### The Toyhouse Pipeline
- Prisoners may be transformed into toys
- Parts harvested for puppet-making
- Forced labor creating Skabatha's creations
- "Good behavior" means transfer to the Toyhouse (not necessarily better)

### Little Treats Orphanage
- "Suitable" children transferred there
- Families kept here to ensure obedience
- Threat of prison keeps orphans compliant

## Hooks & Quests

### Rescue Mission
- Harengon prisoners need rescue from impossible prison
- Approaching Cinder Hold is suicidal without Skabatha's permission
- Must find way to neutralize or trick the treant
- **Timing matters**: Next sacrifice could be in days

### The Prison Politics Quest
- Arrive during factional chaos
- Could unite factions by revealing rigged voting
- Could take sides (but which side is right?)
- Could try to end sacrifice system entirely (nearly impossible)
- Yanaba's parents' faction affects her reaction

### Information Gathering
- Prisoners know about Skabatha's operations
- May have information about the Toyhouse location
- Could reveal weaknesses in Skabatha's domain
- Council records might contain useful intelligence

### Moral Dilemma
- Can't save everyone
- Who to rescue first?
- Some prisoners might be too broken to save
- Rescue attempt might endanger those left behind
- **Take sides in the faction war, or try to unite them?**
- **Reveal the rigged voting, or let sleeping dogs lie?**

## Key NPCs

### The Kidnappers
- Dolgaunts or other Skabatha creatures
- Arrive weekly to collect and execute sacrifice
- Efficient, brutal, don't speak much
- Sometimes accompanied by Caldrien/Velisara or other witnesses
- **Cinder Hold allows them entry** - they have Skabatha's permission

### Separatist Leader [Name TBD]
- Young, strong Harengon
- Led the coup, now in charge
- Conflicted about sacrificing the elderly
- Believes they're being fair: "It's their turn"
- Doesn't know the voting was rigged
- **Could be reasoned with if shown evidence**

### Council Elder [Name TBD]
- Elderly Harengon, former Council member
- Currently jailed by separatists
- Knows about the rigged voting
- Desperate to survive
- **Might confess to save themselves**
- Represents the old corruption

### The Moderate [Name TBD]
- Middle-aged Harengon
- Sees both sides, horrified by both
- Wants to end the sacrifice system entirely
- Knows it's impossible but hasn't given up
- **Potential ally for party**
- Could help unite factions if truth comes out

### Other Notable Prisoners
- [TBD - Could include plot-relevant NPCs or quest-givers]

## Escape Difficulty
- **Extreme security**: The prison itself is alive and hostile
- **No guards to trick or bribe**: Only the treant's corrupted will
- **Approaching is deadly**: Cinder Hold crushes anyone who gets near without permission
- **Leaving is deadly**: Prisoners who try to escape are crushed immediately
- **Magical wards**: Prevent simple teleportation solutions
- **Mobile prison**: Roams northeast Thither, hard to track or plan around
- **Requires Skabatha's permission or extremely powerful magic**: No conventional rescue possible
- **Stealth is nearly impossible**: The tree senses movement within and around it

## Complications
- **The prison itself is the threat**: Cinder Hold will crush intruders
- **No way to sneak in**: The treant senses all movement
- **Hostage situation**: Attempting rescue endangers all prisoners
- **Skabatha's attention**: She may come personally if Cinder Hold is threatened
- **Pursuit**: Escaped prisoners are hunted by the treant itself
- **Guilt**: Can't save everyone, must leave some behind
- **The prison moves**: Today's location may not be tomorrow's

## Loot & Rewards
- **Prisoners' gratitude**: Future allies in Thither
- **Information**: About Skabatha, the Toyhouse, and Thither
- **Key/Map**: To other Skabatha facilities
- **Skabatha's notes**: Revealing her plans
- **Magic items**: Confiscated from prisoners

## Aftermath
- **If successful rescue**: Made an enemy of Skabatha (if not already)
- **If prisoners freed**: Potential allies, but also refugees needing protection
- **Skabatha's response**: Increased vigilance, hunting parties, retaliation
- **Cinder Hold itself**: May be directed to hunt down escapees

## Atmosphere & Themes
- **Despair**: Many prisoners have lost hope
- **Survival**: Constant struggle in impossible situation
- **The Living Prison**: Horror of being trapped in a corrupted, sentient tree
- **Choice**: Who to save when you can't save everyone
- **Rebellion**: Some prisoners may fight back during rescue
- **The Wanderer**: Dread of not knowing where the prison will be tomorrow

## DM Notes
- This location should feel oppressive and dangerous
- Consider party level before having them attempt rescue
- Could be endgame location for Skabatha's arc
- Balance darkness with hope—this is still D&D, not grimdark
- The **roaming nature** makes it unpredictable and terrifying

### The Living Prison
- **Cinder Hold is a CR 15+ threat** as a corrupted ancient treant
- Cannot be fought conventionally by most parties
- Requires clever solutions: Skabatha's permission, powerful magic, or finding its weakness
- The tree may still have fragments of Yggmir's original consciousness
- Could it be reasoned with? Freed from corruption?
- Or is it too far gone, a tragic monster?

### The Sacrifice System
- **Harengon as food source should be revealed gradually** (horror moment)
- Players might try to stop the sacrifice—have contingencies
- The public execution is meant to be brutal and horrifying
- Don't describe graphic details, but convey the horror through prisoner reactions
- This creates urgency: next sacrifice could be soon

### The Political Situation
- **No clear "good guys"**: Council was corrupt, separatists are executing elderly
- Both sides have legitimate grievances
- Revealing rigged voting changes everything but doesn't solve the core problem
- The sacrifice system continues regardless of who's in charge
- Party could try to unite factions to rebel, but that's dangerous
- Even united, the prisoners can't escape Cinder Hold without outside help

### Session Planning Note
- **CRITICAL LORE**: Harengon are the primary food source for all creatures of Thither
- This explains Skabatha's breeding program's true purpose
- Not just for toys/orphans—it's for feeding her domain
- Dark fairy tale horror: the "rabbit people" are livestock
- This revelation should hit players hard
- **No conventional guards or wardens** - the prison itself is the threat
- **Cinder Hold roams northeast Thither** - tracking it is part of the challenge

## Future Development
- Map of prison complex
- Guard stat blocks
- Specific prisoner NPCs with names and stories
- Skabatha's orders/notes found in prison
- Escape routes and secret passages
- Timing: When do kidnappers try to take Yanaba here?

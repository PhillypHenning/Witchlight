### (Player) meets Barnaby
While the players are at camp, one of the players enter into the woods (ask what they are doing), and while doing what they are doing they hear the strike of a match a few feet away. A short distance off a large humanoid with a basset hound head in a brownish trench coat leans on a tree. In one hand is a match with a thick long flame, in the other a pipe. "Morning friend, sorry to botha you, was just wondering if you have 5 minutes to speak"

Y: The hound puffs on the pipe for a moment, the ember withing glowing with hues of red and orance. He chucks the match to the ground, pulls out a pocket-watch and checks the time. "Do you know a fella named Sevro?"

Y: "I'm just curious about the chap, what kind of person is he, the deals he's made, eccetra."

Barnaby was sent as an urgent request from the lower council of faerun domestic regicide, familicide and the undeserved aggression towards small animals. He's been tasked with getting information on all parties he's sold his soul to and any evidence that might point to Servo being undeserved of life

He goes to each player and does the same thing.

### Barany holds a court "for the soul of Servro"
Etheral Chains spring from around your Sevro, wrapping around your arms and legs, holding you fast in place.

"Fiesty one", the hound begins making arcane runes in the air, glowing as he draws and exploding as he seemingly finishes. It finishes as quick as it started, "Give everyone a moment. Mr. Hats I believe you have a case as well?"

Mister Hats: "I dos, I dos!"

A ring of fire begins to cirle in the air beside Di, the size of a medium-sized person. Two large red-brown arms, thick as electrical poles bursts through, the massive hands grabbing either side of the portal and stretching until it towers over each of you. Massive horns adorned with gold and silver necklaces force their way through.

(Jamican) "HA HA, Looks like your bullshit finally caught up with you little bard." A massive grin paints the massive devil's face as his black eyes stare at Sevro.

[AT_SOME_POINT] "Di, I'm disappointed in you. I would have expected you to be much stronger by now, tisk tisk."

The hound stands beside Sevro. "This will have to do as a courtroom for today. This is the case for who owns Sevro's soul." The creature looks at his pocket-watch again, then back at Sevro. "It might need to be a short court as well. Da Da Da (wasting time), 5 more seconds and all other applicants will forfeit their chance to claim. Da Da and there we go"

Barnaby: "Right then, from my understanding Mr. Hats you are asking for the body?"

Mr. Hats: "Correct"

Barnaby: "Chopaign, you'd like his soul?"

Chopaign: "Yaaah man"

Barnaby: "Then this is open and shut. I Barnaby of the inevitable makes his judgement." With a flick of the wrist; a scroll and pen spark into existance and begins furiously moving about writing something.

The hound looks back at his pocket-watch then looks up "In record time. I am grateful for all of your assistance folks, take care now."

A moment later Barnaby is gone, as if his existence wasn't and the time with him isn't.


### A small amount of time goes by then move on

### Knight's entrance
From somewhere off in the distance a throaty voice can be heard.
"FALSE KING SEVRO."

A man in ill fitting plate armor sitting atop a donkey strides "gallantly" into view. As the stead comes to a halt, the man strikes a heroic pose and stare at you. A small frog in squire attair runs frantically up the hill.

(Puddle): "Sir, please do not run away like that!"

(Sir. Toadstool): "It's okay young squire, I believe I've finally found my quarry. Please hand my weapons to me and begin to prepare our speech."

*The squire hands the knight a metal gauntlet

(Sir. Toadstool): "FALSE KING SEVRO. _ribbit_. I have finally found you. GENERATIONS have passed since you stole the crown from my people, the good tadpoles and ribbitfolk of Downfall, aimless, are town falling apart! You murdered our king and set the sunken court to confusion. _ribbit_. BUT TODAY, THAT ENDS. _ribbit_ We fight here and now, you and I, just the two of us. For the future of my home, Downfall. Fight me!"

### Characters intervene
1. Roll initiative for all characters, they have the option to do something as well
2. End of turn one the sword at Di's side begins to burn hot and the eye in the middle clearly is focused on the Sevro situation
3. End of turn two a portal opens up beside Di and Chopaign walks through
4. On Chopaign's turn he begins to tell Di about the irony of his decision to trade is prayers to Gond, for his indentured servatitude to him as his previous powers would have allowed him to save Sevro in a way that would have saved hin.

## Sir Hip Toadstoll
- Regular Bullywug from a stats perspective
- Has a silver sword that the Bullywog people have put their trust in called "KingSlayer"
    - Normal long sword for stats
    - If attacking Sevro, it automatically crits and the number of dice is tripled (then doubled)


## Old bits

A knight in shining armor emerges from the treeline, a gaggle of frog-like humanoids following behind it carrying different items and flags in their hands, murmuring to one another.

"THIEF KING SEVRO. _Ribbit_. I CHALLENGE YOU! TODAY WILL BE YOUR END, TODAY WILL BE THE DAY THE CROWN IS RETURNED TO MY PEOPLE. TODAY WILL BE THE DAY I BECOME THE KING OF DOWNFALL."

---

Di, the sword at your hip is red hot. You glance down quickly, a familiar eye sits in the middle of the hilt glaring towards the scene unfolding infront of you.

---

Screams begin filling the air as a red portal springs to life beside you. The magic swirls within it, and through it you can see a hellscape. Two large red, brown hands emerge grabbing the sides of the portal and stretching it open further. From it, Chopaign emerges with a chuckle.

"It's been a long while since I left Avernus, but to watch Sevro die, ha ha, I couldn't miss that now could I." 

---

Chopaign: "Di. You became my follower in exchange for the soul of Sevro.. I personally hate the man and couldn't wait to add his poor little whines and wails to my colleciton. But I put that aside. Do you know why I did that?"

"Because I realized I had a means of getting the wails and whines of more than just Sevro. Your friend is dying in front of you now, so tragic, you must feel awful. But do you know the irony of it all Di?"

"The irony Di is that before you were my follower you were a cleric of Gond and had you kept being a cleric of Gond you would have the power in this moment to save Sevro's soul. I of course could save him and I could offer that power to you but I won't be doing that. I'm happy to take this little worm's soul, but take sollace in the fact that one day, your soul's wails will be reunited with him."

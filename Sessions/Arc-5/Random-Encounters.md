# Random Encounters (d20)

## 1. Yarnspinner "Editor"
A single Yarnspinner "editor" appears, irritated that the party's story is getting "inconsistent." They offer to "fix the narrative" in exchange for a memory or a secret. If refused, the party finds themselves heading towards either the casino or spa.

## 2. VIP Invitations
Dozens of glossy invitations hang from twine between trees, each addressed to a party member by name. Taking one causes a faint, warm brand-like itch on the wrist (no damage); later, casino staff recognize it as "VIP marking."

## 3. Flying Rocking Horse
Cackling fills the sky; you look up overhead and watch a large wood doll riding a flying rocking horse sail across the sky.

## 5. Casino Enforcers (Bearded Devils)
Party runs into 2 Bearded Devils, employees of the Casino, disguised as humans in fine red clothing.
The two will ask the party whether they know of the Starved Goblin Casino and when they plan to visit. They will become more and more pushy if the party doesn't seem interested, offering up to "VIP and the first 6 games free"

## 6. [DONE:SEREN] Raining Cats and Dogs
It begins raining cats and dogs. As the party what they do as the creatures begin to rain from the sky down onto them. Anyone who doesn't take cover needs to make a DC 14 dex check or take 2d6/2 damage.

## 7. Gaberwhocky vs. Owlbear
An owlbear stocks into a small clearing ahead of you. The large creature has purple feathers and a large sharp beak. It stands up on its two back legs and begins sniffing the air.

DC 18 CHArisma check, on a fail the member is effected by confusion and can't move from where they stand watching the creature.

A strange babble fills the air and worms itself into your ears. The sound of mad men, of yellow kings and nightmare dreamscapes. There is a wooo-osh overhead as a greasy, scalying body the size of a tower passes overhead and slams into the owlbear you have been watching. A shrill screech escapes the owlbear for but a moment, then a meaty crunching noise, then silence. The babbling stops as the dragon-like creature begins to feast on its prey leaving you with a headache and queasy stomach.

## 8. Cotton Candy Bushes
Cotton candy bushes cluster along the path. Running between them are sugar-goblins who snatch and ravenously eat the cotton candy bushes. If the players attempt to take any, the goblins attack them. The sugar goblins are for the most part neutral and can speak goblin.

## 9. Victim of Never Leave
A bloody mess of a man with fingers missing and chunks taken out of him wanders the forest, whimpering about "wanting to hit the spa to feel better."

## 10. Victim of the Casino
A hollow husk of a woman stands in a clearing staring off into space. If approached she begs the party for any valuables and offers "to do anything to get it." If asked why, she tells them she wishes to return to the Casino.

## 11. Straw Doll Beacon
A toy straw doll sits upright in the path. If picked up, it "thanks" them and asks to be taken home. It then begins quietly attracting predators/henchmen as if it's a beacon.

## 12. Lost Fairy Soldier: "Orders From the 5 Wings War"

A palm-sized fairy in a battered tin cuirass and a paper-plumed helmet drops from the canopy and lands in a perfect parade stance. They demand to know why the party is "off-route" and sheepishly asks for directions to the Floating Isles, insisting they must report back to **King Thistledart, Monarch of the Sprites**
on the status of the 5 Wings War immediately.

- If treated kindly, the fairy offers to introduce them to their King
- If mocked or threatened, they blow a tiny whistle and yells "arrest these deserters."

## 13. [DONE:YANABA] The Orchard of Borrowed Smiles

A small orchard of pale fruit trees bears strange fruit shaped like smiling mouths. The smiles giggle when plucked.

- Eating one grants advantage on the next Charisma check in the next hour, but the eater's face becomes expressionless for the same duration (disadvantage on Insight, or NPCs distrust them).
- The ground beneath the trees is littered with old masks and broken makeup kits.

## 14. [DONE:KARAG] The Quiet Where Sound Should Be (Spa Foreshadow)

The forest abruptly loses sound—no insects, no wind, no footsteps. Conversation comes out as a faint whisper no matter how loud you speak.

- After 1 minute, everyone makes a DC 13 Wis save. On a failure, they forget the last 10 minutes of travel (you can reposition them slightly, or tick your major encounter tracker forward).
- A success notices a faint, distant "melody" that seems to come from behind them no matter where they turn.

## 15. Casino Chip Rain
It begins to rain hot brass casino chips that hiss when they hit leaves. Each chip has a sin stamped on it (GREED, PRIDE, etc.). Collecting chips is tempting: each chip can be spent later at the casino as 1 gp or cashed for a minor boon (inspiration, advantage on one Charisma check)… but each chip carried imposes a cumulative -1 to Wisdom saves vs casino impulse (max -3) until a long rest.

## 16. Yarnspinner Story Weavers
A pack of Yarnspinner's story weavers find the party in the woods. They ask questions about who they are, what they are, what they do, all the while one of them fervently writes all that is being said. Once satisfied, they welcome the party to come visit Fablerise. 

The party begins to forget their names and backstories.

## 17. Skabatha's "Kidnapper" (Dolgaunt)
Skabatha's "kidnapper" finds them in the woods. (1x Dolgaunt)

## 18. Mind-Worming Dark (Dex/Int)
The forest grows dark and worms itself into your mind. Disadvantage on Dex and Int checks; removed on long rest.

## 19. Somber Grey Fog (Str/Wis)
The forest grows somber and grey; likewise you feel a fog within your mind. Disadvantage on Str and Wis checks; removed on long rest.

## 20. Energy Sap (Con/Cha)
The forest seems to lean towards you; like vampires draining their prey of blood, you are sapped of energy. Disadvantage on Con and Cha checks; removed on long rest.

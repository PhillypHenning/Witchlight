# Velisara & Caldrien - The Casino Owners

## Velisara (Succubus - CR 4)

**Appearance:**
Velisara appears as a strikingly beautiful woman with copper skin, dark cascading hair, and eyes that shift between amber and crimson depending on her mood. She wears elegant gowns of deep reds and blacks, adorned with gold jewelry that seems to writhe subtly when not directly observed. Small horns peek through her hair, and her shadow occasionally reveals wings and a tail—details her illusion usually hides.

**Personality:**
- **Charming**: Velisara is the face of the casino, greeting important guests personally
- **Manipulative**: Excels at reading desires and exploiting them
- **Greedy**: Always calculating profit margins, never satisfied with "enough"
- **Proud**: Takes personal offense when guests leave with more than they came with

**Backstory:**
Velisara ascended from the pits of Avernus through cunning and charm. She grew tired of serving greater devils and sought independence. When she met Caldrien, they formed a partnership—her business sense combined with his social manipulation created the perfect predatory enterprise. The Hourglass Coven granted them permission to operate in Thither as neutral ground, with the understanding that they would harvest mortal desperation and report notable visitors.

**Goals:**
- Maximize profit while maintaining the casino's "classy" reputation
- Collect mortal souls through gambling debts
- Eliminate competition (especially Never Leave Spa)
- Eventually break free from the Coven's oversight

**Tactics:**
- Uses Charm Person liberally on high-rollers
- Employs Detect Thoughts to identify what guests value most
- Offers "special deals" to desperate gamblers
- Maintains plausible deniability about casino's darker elements

## Caldrien (Incubus - CR 4)

**Appearance:**
Caldrien appears as a devastatingly handsome man with dark hair, sharp features, and a smile that promises secrets. He dresses in immaculate suits of midnight blue and silver, with cufflinks that sparkle like stars. Unlike Velisara, he makes no effort to hide his otherworldly nature—small horns, slight points to his ears, and eyes that glow faintly in dim light are all visible. He considers it part of his appeal.

**Personality:**
- **Seductive**: Masters the art of making everyone feel like the most important person in the room
- **Lustful**: Collects hearts and breaks them, both literally and figuratively
- **Patient**: Plays the long game, building trust before the betrayal
- **Vain**: Obsessed with his appearance and reputation

**Backstory:**
Caldrien has been operating in the mortal realms for centuries, moving from court to court, seducing nobility and collecting souls. He grew bored of the same patterns and sought something more challenging. The casino offered him endless variety—new marks every night, each with different weaknesses. His partnership with Velisara is both professional and occasionally romantic, though neither trusts the other completely.

**Goals:**
- Experience novel forms of desire and desperation
- Build a collection of "interesting" souls (artists, heroes, etc.)
- Outmaneuver Velisara to become sole owner
- Maintain his reputation as Thither's most desirable bachelor

**Tactics:**
- Uses Charm Person on those resistant to Velisara
- Employs Etherealness to spy on private conversations
- Offers himself as "prize" in high-stakes games (always has escape plan)
- Identifies emotional vulnerabilities and exploits them

## Their Partnership

**Strengths:**
- Complementary skills (she handles business, he handles people)
- Shared greed and ambition
- Both bound by contract to serve the Hourglass Coven (mutual weakness creates trust)
- Genuine respect for each other's abilities

**Tensions:**
- Both want to be the "real" boss
- Compete for the most impressive soul collection
- Disagree on risk tolerance (she's conservative, he's reckless)
- Jealousy over each other's conquests

**Bound to the Hourglass Coven:**
Both Velisara and Caldrien signed contracts with the three hags to operate in Thither. In exchange for:
- Protection from rival devils
- Exclusive gambling rights
- Access to Feywild resources

They must:
- Maintain the casino as neutral ground for all factions
- Report notable visitors to the Coven
- Never interfere with the hags' plans
- Pay tribute (10% of souls collected)

They resent this arrangement but fear the Coven's power. If the party helps overthrow the hags, the owners would be freed from their contracts—though they'd immediately begin consolidating power for themselves.

## Di's Interrogation Scene

**Context:**
When Di is flagged by the security detection stone (due to Chopaign's patronage), the owners will want to assess him. Chopaign is one of the 6 Night Shades of Cania—powerful pit fiends in Mephistar—and any mortal with such a patron is noteworthy.

**The Interrogation:**
- **Location**: Private room off the main floor, luxurious but isolated
- **Present**: Both Velisara and Caldrien (they handle important matters together)
- **Tone**: Not hostile, but probing—they want to gauge Di's character and loyalty

**Key Questions They'll Ask:**
1. "How did a mortal come to serve one of the Night Shades?"
2. "What does Chopaign want in the Feywild?"
3. "Are you hunting for him, or are you being hunted?"
4. "What does he offer you that's worth your soul?"

**Critical Information They'll Reveal:**
> "While you're within these walls, the casino nullifies any connection you have with your patron. He cannot see, hear, or sense you here. Neutral ground, remember? What's said in the casino stays in the casino—unless we choose to share it."

This serves multiple purposes:
- Tests if Di will speak freely without his patron's oversight
- Reveals the casino has powerful wards/magic
- Implies they could offer protection if needed
- Makes Di more valuable if he shares information

**Gauging Loyalty:**
They're watching for:
- Does he protect Chopaign's secrets? (Loyal or fearful)
- Does he share information freely? (Desperate or treacherous)
- Does he seem trapped or willing? (Potential ally or lost cause)
- Does he ask about breaking patron bonds? (Very interesting)

**If Di Shows Willingness to Talk:**
Velisara will take the lead, softening her approach:
- "You seem like someone in a difficult position."
- "We're not friends of the Night Shades. Their kind doesn't belong in our realm."
- "Perhaps we could help each other..."

**Velisara's Spy Work Offer:**
If Di seems pliable or interesting, Velisara will approach him separately (after the interrogation, while Caldrien is distracted):

> "I have a proposition. Someone with your... connections... could be very useful to us. There are things we need to know. Information that someone close to the Coven might discover. Work for us, and we work for you."

**The Safe Question:**
As part of gauging his usefulness, Velisara will ask:

> "Tell me something only you would know. Something personal. For instance—what is the true color of your eyes?"

**Hidden Context:**
- This question is one of three security questions to a safe the owners are aware of
- The safe belongs to someone connected to Di's past (not revealed to players yet)
- Velisara asking this reveals she has information about Di's background
- Whether Di answers truthfully or lies will be noted

**What They Offer:**
- Information about the Hourglass Coven's movements
- Safe passage through dangerous areas
- Casino prizes without gambling
- Protection from Chopaign (while inside casino walls)
- Eventually: Help breaking his patron bond (if they gain something massive in return)

**What They Want:**
- Intel on Chopaign's plans in the Feywild
- Information about the party's movements
- Details about any deals with the Hagspawn
- Advance warning if anyone comes hunting for the casino
- The answer to security questions for certain valuable safes

**DM Notes:**
- This is a major decision moment for Di/Dan
- Double-crossing the casino owners has consequences
- But so does staying loyal to Chopaign
- Velisara won't force an immediate answer—she plants seeds
- The safe question should intrigue the player without revealing too much
- Track what Di reveals; the owners will remember everything

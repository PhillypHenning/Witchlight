## The Orphanage

**Exterior:**
A large, cheerful-looking house painted in pastel colors. Window boxes with dead flowers (disguised to look alive). Sign: "Little Treats Orphanage - Every Child Deserves Love." Playground equipment that looks fun but is slightly wrong (swings creak ominously, slide is too steep, seesaw is unbalanced).

**Ground Floor:**
- **Kitchen**: Always smells of baking, but food tastes like ash. Oven is large enough for a child. "Treats" line the counters.
- **Dining Hall**: Long tables, small chairs. Children eat in silence. Paintings on walls show happy children (but their eyes follow you).
- **Playroom**: Toys are all slightly broken or unsettling. Dolls with knowing expressions. Rocking horse that rocks by itself.
- **Miss Able's Office**: Neat, organized. Ledger listing all children with notes: "disobedient," "nearly ready," "perfect candidate."

**Second Floor:**
- **Dormitories**: Rows of small beds. Children sleep fitfully. Nightmares are common (Er feeds on them).
- **Punishment Room**: Locked. Contains cages, restraints, and tools for "correction."
- **Bathroom**: Cold water only. Mirrors are cracked. Towels are threadbare.

**Basement/Cellar:**
- Er's true lair when not maintaining disguise
- Storage for "ingredients" (disturbing)
- Portal to Hag coven meeting space
- Children who "misbehave too much" are kept here

**Attic:**
- Storage for children's confiscated belongings (toys, trinkets from their old lives)
- Er's personal treasure hoard
- Cursed items and dark magic components

## The Children

All orphans are genuinely orphaned or kidnapped from Feywild/Material Plane. They're being:
1. Traumatized to harvest nightmare energy
2. Groomed to become servants for Skabatha
3. Evaluated as potential ingredients for dark rituals
4. Conditioned to fear/obey hags

**Notable Children:**

**Tam** (Human boy, 8):
- Newest arrival, still has hope
- Remembers his parents
- Tries to protect younger kids
- Punishment target (Er wants to break his spirit)

**Lissie** (Halfling girl, 10):
- Been here 2 years, mostly broken
- Follows rules perfectly
- Warns newcomers to "be good"
- Er considers her "nearly ready" for service

**Grimble** (Goblin, 6) - *WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL STAFF*:
- Ran away from carnival, was caught by Skabatha's agents
- Terrified, won't speak
- Recognizes party if they mention carnival
- Key to one of party's quests

**Pip & Pep** (Gnome twins, 7):
- Arrived together 6 months ago
- Communicate in whispers, finish each other's sentences
- Know secret passages in orphanage
- Planning escape but too scared to try

**Others** (5-10 more):
- Various ages and races
- All show signs of trauma
- Some have given up hope entirely
- A few still have fight left in them

## Star (Displacer Kitten)

**What It Is**: Baby displacer beast, about the size of a large house cat. Looks like black panther cub with tentacles and slight shimmer.

**Backstory**: 
- Witchlight Carnival attraction/pet
- Escaped during chaos when party left
- Tracked to Thither, captured by Er's agents
- Now kept as "pet" in orphanage
- Children love it, Er uses it as leverage ("Be good or kitty gets punished")

**Personality**:
- Playful, affectionate, scared
- Bonds with kind people
- Hisses at Er even in disguise
- Displacement ability makes it hard to catch (advantage on Dex saves)

**Location**: Usually found in playroom or kitchen, sometimes hidden by children in dormitory

**Stats**: Use Cat stats but add:
- **Displacement**: Attacks against it have disadvantage
- **Tentacles**: Can make second attack (1 piercing damage)

## The Orphanage Rules (Posted Everywhere)

1. Wake at dawn, sleep at dusk
2. Speak only when spoken to
3. Clean plates at every meal
4. No crying, no shouting, no laughter above a giggle
5. Obey Miss Able immediately
6. Tell Miss Able if anyone breaks rules
7. Punishment is for your own good
8. You are lucky to be here
9. Nobody leaves without permission
10. **Only children are allowed inside**

**Rule #10 is magically enforced**: Adults who try to enter without permission must make DC 15 Wisdom save or turn back, forgetting why they came. Children and those invited by Er can enter freely.

## Er's Daily Routine

**Morning**:
- Wakes children at dawn with harsh bell
- Inspects dormitories for infractions
- Serves breakfast (barely edible porridge)
- Assigns chores

**Afternoon**:
- "Lessons" (indoctrination, fear conditioning)
- Supervises play (no fun allowed)
- Bakes "treats" (actually analyzing children for ritual purposes)
- Paperwork (correspondence with Skabatha)

**Evening**:
- Dinner (slightly better than breakfast, still awful)
- Punishment hour (public discipline of rule-breakers)
- Bedtime prayers (to Skabatha, though children don't know that)
- Lights out

**Night**:
- Drops disguise
- Feeds on children's nightmares via **Nightmare Haunting**
- Reports to Skabatha
- Plans future "acquisitions"

---

## Nightmare Haunting

Er uses this ability to feed on the children every night:

**Mechanics**:
- Targets one sleeping creature
- Range: must touch or be on Ethereal Plane within 10 ft
- Target has visions of worst fears
- Takes 5d10 psychic damage (Con save DC 15 for half)
- Reduced to 0 HP = unconscious 1 minute, then wakes
- Er regains HP equal to damage dealt
- **Children are targeted repeatedly**, keeping them weak and terrified

**Signs of Haunting**:
- Dark circles under eyes
- Exhaustion
- Fear of sleeping
- Flinching at shadows
- Talking in sleep

---

## Encounter Design

**Discovery**:
- Ghost children from random encounter mention orphanage
- Star's trail leads here
- Rumors in Thither about "terrible orphanage"
- Skabatha's agents reference it

**The Problem**:
- **Only children can enter** (Rule #10 is magically enforced)
- Party must find way around ward or use child-sized members (gnomes, halflings, or polymorph)
- Breaking in triggers alarm (Er knows immediately)

**Getting Inside**:
1. **Polymorph** into children
2. **Deception**: Claim to be new orphans
3. **Invitation**: Get Er to invite them (very difficult)
4. **Ethereal**: Ghost through walls
5. **Shrink**: Reduce Person to child size
6. **Distraction**: Some sneak in while others keep Er busy
7. **Help from inside**: Children let them in through secret passages

**Confrontation**:
- Er drops disguise when threatened
- Uses children as hostages/shields
- Calls for reinforcements (Skabatha's agents)
- Fights viciously but will plane shift if losing
- Heartstone on her person (valuable)

**Rescue**:
- Children are traumatized, need gentle handling
- Star must be found (might be hidden)
- Other captives might be present
- Evidence of Skabatha's plans in office

## Er's Tactics

**In Disguise**:
- Plays helpless old woman
- Guilts party ("How dare you threaten me in front of the children!")
- Uses children as human shields
- Calls for "help" (agents arrive in 1d4 rounds)

**True Form**:
- **Claws**: +7 to hit, 2d8+4 slashing
- **Magic Resistance**: Advantage on saves vs spells
- **Nightmare Haunting**: Uses on party members if they sleep here
- **Etherealness**: Turns ethereal to escape or reposition
- **Change Shape**: Switches between forms mid-combat to confuse
- **Heartstone**: Can become ethereal, plane shift, cast magic jar

**If Losing**:
- Threatens to kill children
- Plane shifts away (to Skabatha's domain)
- Curses party before fleeing
- Promises revenge

---

## Aftermath

**If Er is Defeated**:
- Children slowly begin to recover
- Orphanage revealed as horror show
- Evidence of Skabatha's operations found
- Grimble and Star rescued
- Other factions in Thither react (some grateful, some worried about power vacuum)

**What to Do With Children**:
- Can't just leave them
- Might need to find homes/families
- Some could join carnival
- Others might have leads on Skabatha
- All are traumatized, need care

**Skabatha's Response**:
- Loses valuable asset
- Becomes aware of party as serious threat
- Might send stronger agents
- Could move timetable up on other plans

---

## Connections

**To Witchlight Carnival**: Grimble and Star need rescue
**To Skabatha**: Er reports directly to her
**To Ghost Children**: They died here or were "released" by Er
**To Other Locations**: Children were kidnapped from across Thither

## DM Notes

**Tone**: This should be genuinely unsettling. Children in danger, abuse by authority figure, nightmares made real. Handle with care for player comfort.

**Player Agency**: Don't force party to witness child abuse directly. Imply, suggest, let them discover aftermath. Focus on rescue, not torture porn.

**Combat Balance**: Er is CR 5, dangerous but manageable. Add minions if party is strong. Remove them if party is struggling.

**Rule #10 Workaround**: Make it a puzzle, not a wall. Players should feel clever finding solution, not frustrated by barrier.

**Children as Characters**: Give them personalities, hopes, fears. Make party care about saving them specifically, not just "orphans in general."

**Grimble & Star**: These are quest objectives. Don't kill them off-screen or make them impossible to find. Reward thorough investigation.

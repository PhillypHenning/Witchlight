# The 4-Way Ambush

## Overview
A coordinated ambush where three members of the party are simultaneously attacked by different enemies, each with their own agenda. This encounter is designed to split the party's attention and resources while advancing multiple plot threads.

## Timing
Major encounter (every 6 overland actions). Place this when:
- Party has left the casino and is traveling through Thither
- Preferably when party is somewhat spread out or distracted
- After at least one rest since casino (to ensure they're not completely drained)

## The Four Simultaneous Attacks

### 1. Sevro's Attack - The Frog Knight Returns

**Attacker**: Frog knight (likely another of Bavlorna's knights) + 3 frog archers

**Motivation**: 
- Revenge for previous frog knight (Kagg) who died attacking Sevro
- Bavlorna's orders to eliminate the "troublemaker"
- Personal honor/duty

**Setup**:
- Frog knight challenges Sevro directly
- "You killed my brother-in-arms! Face me, killer!"
- 3 archers spread out, providing covering fire and preventing escape
- Knight wants single combat but archers will interfere if Sevro's winning

**Tactics**:
- Knight engages Sevro in melee
- Archers focus fire on anyone trying to help Sevro
- If knight falls quickly, archers retreat
- If fight drags on, archers close in

**Stats**: 
- Frog Knight: [TBD - similar to Kagg]
- Frog Archers: [TBD - CR 1-2 each]

**Conclusion**:
- Dead knight becomes another mark against party with Bavlorna
- Captured knight could provide information
- Retreat means they'll be back with reinforcements

### 2. Yanaba's Attack - The Kidnappers

**Attackers**: Skabatha's creatures (dolgaunts or similar aberrations)

**Motivation**:
- Skabatha Nightshade wants more "children" for Little Treats Orphanage
- Harengon are particularly valuable to her
- Yanaba's parents are already imprisoned—she's the missing piece

**Setup**:
- Creatures emerge from shadows/burrows
- Move with eerie silence and purpose
- Focus entirely on capturing Yanaba alive
- Use nets, grapples, and restraints
- Ignore other party members unless they interfere

**Tactics**:
- Swarm Yanaba specifically
- Attempt to grapple and drag her away
- Non-lethal tactics only for Yanaba
- Lethal force authorized for anyone else who interferes
- Goal: Take her to Cinder Hold Prison where her parents are held

**Stats**:
- [TBD - Dolgaunts CR 3, or custom creatures]
- 2-4 kidnappers depending on party level

**Conclusion**:
- If successful: Yanaba captured, party must rescue her from Cinder Hold Prison
- If failed: Creatures retreat, but now party knows Skabatha is targeting Yanaba
- Captured creature reveals: "The Night Shade wants the rabbit-child. The family will be complete."

### 3. Karag's Attack - The Shadowy Spirits

**Attackers**: Three shadowy spirits [stat block undecided]

**Motivation**:
- Connected to Karag's status as "Heir of Twilight"
- Testing his worthiness? Claiming him? Protecting him?
- Unclear whether hostile or protective gone wrong

**Setup**:
- Shadows coalesce from darkness around Karag
- Move with unnatural fluidity
- Speak in whispers: "Heir..." "Return..." "Remember..."
- Attack with cold, draining touches

**Seren's Compulsion** (potential):
- Seren feels an overwhelming need to protect Karag
- Wisdom save to resist throwing herself between Karag and spirits
- No clear reason why—just instinctual
- Could be divine calling, or something about Karag's true nature

**Tactics**:
- Surround Karag
- Attempt to separate him from the party
- Drain his strength/life force
- Cease attack if Karag speaks certain words? Shows certain symbol?
- May be "testing" rather than trying to kill

**Stats**:
- [TBD - Shadow-based creatures, CR 2-3 each]
- Resistance to non-magical weapons
- Vulnerability to radiant damage
- Strength drain attacks

**Conclusion**:
- Spirits fade with final words: "Not yet ready..." or "Soon, heir..."
- Karag's connection to Twilight Court deepened
- More questions about what "Heir of Twilight" means
- Why did Seren feel compelled to protect him?

## Running the Encounter

### Initiative & Positioning
- All three attacks begin on the same turn (coordinated but not allied)
- Roll separate initiatives for each group:
  - Frog Knight & Archers
  - Kidnappers
  - Shadowy Spirits
- Party members are likely spread out or caught off-guard

### Split Attention
- Each party member must decide: help themselves or help others
- Resource management becomes critical
- AOE effects might hit allies
- Communication is difficult across battlefield

### Victory Conditions

**For the Party**:
- Survive without Yanaba being captured
- Defeat or drive off all three groups
- Learn information from attackers
- Protect each other despite split focus

**For the Attackers**:
- **Frog Knight**: Kill or seriously wound Sevro
- **Kidnappers**: Capture Yanaba alive
- **Spirits**: Test/claim/drain Karag

### Complications
- Other party members (Di, Seren if not with Karag) must choose who to help
- Healing resources spread thin
- Each group has different weaknesses and tactics
- Retreat may be wise but difficult

### Post-Battle
- Multiple plot threads advanced
- Information revealed about enemy factions
- Urgency increased (Skabatha actively hunting Yanaba)
- Karag's mystery deepens
- Party realizes they're being watched by multiple factions

## Loot & Rewards
- Frog Knight: [TBD - possible magic item, letter from Bavlorna]
- Kidnappers: [TBD - Map to Cinder Hold Prison, Skabatha's orders]
- Spirits: [TBD - Fragment of twilight essence, cryptic token]

## Follow-Up Hooks
- **Sevro**: More frog knights will come. Bavlorna wants him dead.
- **Yanaba**: Parents are at Cinder Hold Prison. Skabatha knows about her.
- **Karag**: The Twilight Court is calling. What does it want?
- **All**: Multiple factions are tracking them. How did they coordinate?

## DM Notes
- This encounter is meant to be overwhelming and cinematic
- Don't kill PCs, but make them feel the danger
- Each attack ties to major arc plot threads
- Success should feel earned but costly
- Failure (especially Yanaba captured) opens new story possibilities
- Adjust difficulty based on party resources and recent encounters

# First Fairy Ring

The path breaks into a fog-soft clearing, the kind that feels like it’s waiting for you to speak first. Mushrooms crowd the grass in impossible colors—blue like bruises, pink like tongues, white like teeth—but the circle itself is unmistakable: a ring of caps, and three larger sentries spaced evenly around it.

Each of the three tall mushrooms is five feet high and oddly *person-shaped*, their stems bearing soft, half-formed faces. The faces are cute in the way a doll is cute—eyes too large, smiles too close to sincere. When the party steps into view, all three faces subtly brighten, like they’ve been expecting company.

One of them gives a little bow. Another waves using a frill of gills like fingers. The third giggles—an innocent, breathy sound—yet the giggle doesn’t match its expression. Its smile is too patient. Too hungry.

“Travelers!” the tallest one chirps, voice like a lullaby sung through damp moss. “Oh, you’re *real*. We’re so pleased. Everyone walks right past us lately. They think we’re… *just mushrooms*.”

The three exchange glances that aren’t quite glances, more like shifts in their softened faces.

“We can help you move through Thither,” it continues brightly. “But we’re feeling… underestimated.”

A beat. Their smiles hold.

“Would you… *prove you understand us?*”

# The Quest Structure (3 rings to “please”)
Each ring is initially friendly and helpful. Each offers a **boon** (direction, shortcut, safe rest, etc.) *if pleased*. As the party engages, the rings reveal their “depravity” as **ritualistic, boundary-pushing fey demands**.

## Ring 1 — “The Underestimated Circle” (Humiliation theme)
**The hook:** “We’re not taken seriously. We need to feel *small* so we can grow.”

### The Three Mushrooms (personalities)
- **Pipcap** (cheerleader): bubbly, encouraging, constantly claps.  
- **Sister Sigh** (melodramatic): speaks like a tragic priest, loves ceremony.  
- **Mister Grin** (too-still): smiles without blinking; laughs half a second late.

### What they want (choose one approach)
They want to be **publicly mocked and “put in their place”**, not flirtation, not innuendo, but **cruel schoolyard humiliation** performed as a formal rite:
- Each PC must deliver one **inventive insult** (or “confession” about why mushrooms are pathetic) while standing inside the ring.

**Mechanics (optional):**
- **Performance or Intimidation DC 13** (sell it).  
- On success, the ring giggles and “accepts the lesson.” On failure, the mushrooms insist it wasn’t mean enough and become petulant (minor nuisance curse: -1 to the next social check until the ring is pleased).

The party needs to succeed pleasing 3 rings in order to activate all of them and travel between them.

## Ring 2 — “The Fertile Circle” (Filth/Fertilizer theme)
**The hook:** “We’re starving. We need *real nourishment*. The kind that makes even angels gag.”

### The Three Mushrooms (personalities)
- **Dr. Puff** (earnest scientist): takes notes on everything, adores “samples.”  
- **Nana Moldmum** (maternal): calls everyone “sprout,” offers awful “snacks.”  
- **Prince Spoor** (vain): obsessed with being “lush” and “vibrant.”

### What they want
They want the party to smear them with something vile-but-useful: **Jabberwocky dung**

**Mechanics (optional):**
- **Survival DC 14** to find a dung-site safely (failure triggers a hazard: lingering madness-whispers, short-term confusion).
- **Con save DC 13** if they do the smearing barehanded without precautions (minor poison/nausea condition for 10 minutes, disadvantage on the next check).

## Ring 3 — “The Thirsty Circle” (Contamination/“watering” theme, non-sexual)
**The hook:** “We want something intimate, not love! Something tainted and distinctly bodily.”

### The Three Mushrooms (personalities)
- **Little Lord Damp** (soft-spoken): whispers, always sounds slightly wet.  
- **Sister Blushcap** (sweet): compliments the party constantly, then asks for “one small awful thing.”  
- **Old Wink** (jokester): makes innocent puns that turn sinister the moment you think about them.

### What they want (replacement for the urination request)
They demand to be “watered” with something **personally tainted**:
- **Spit offering:** each PC must spit into the ring (gross, intimate, debasing without being sexual).
- **Pee:** each PC must pee on the ring

They present it as cute: “Just a sip! Like watering flowers!” Then it becomes clear they want **contamination + surrender of dignity**.

## What’s really going on (the reveal)
All three rings are part of a “court” of mushrooms who get off on:
- being **treated as objects**,  
- receiving **nightmare fertilizer**, and  
- being **ritually defiled** in humiliating little ways.

They never call it sex. They call it *tradition*, *hospitality*, *growth*, *blessings*. That’s the creep: it’s cheerful coercion.

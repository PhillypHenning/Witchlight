## Zalbina's Cottage
1. The players push the massive steel doors built into the underground cave walls open, walking through and back into thick mists. The grey mists ingulf the players, feeling almost like they are travelling through a vast amount of space with every step.
2. It takes some time but eventaully they find themselves in a more open space. An old cottage on a quaint hill, the splash of color quickly catching an eye within the grey mists.
3. The players enter the old cottage and have some time to look around. As they do every soft often the cottage creaks and moans, and very occiasionally the ground shudders. The sound of thuds often in the distance can be heard after a short amount of time.
4. The thuds get louder as Baba Yaga's house stumbles closer. If they players look outside they would see a house held aloft on thick turkey legs the size of a giants.
5. A knock at the door alerts them of he preseence and then Baba Yaga enters. (What does she look like?). She scans the old cottage, her eyes flicking between the many items in the house, a smile plays at the edges of her mouth.
6. Finally she turns and looks at the party and as she does a gret sound of thunder explodes outside. A great amount of noise begins far off in the distance but quickly approaches.
7. Baba Yaga turns and looks at the players and as she does they all begin to shrink (have them make a wisdom check to save (25)).
8. The storm seems to be ontop of the house now, the wooden frame bending and heaving with the storm raging outside.
9. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.
10. The door slowly opens to reveal Endyln, The abdomen of a black spider makes up her lower half. Where the head should be the body of a woman begins, its skin a pale white, her features sharp. Her face was like skin stretched at the rack, bright red lips and a mouth full of daggers. She pushes her way inside
    - "I will not allow this retched smell back in my domain. Who dares.." Endyln
    - "Buried things aren't gone forever it seems" Baba Yaga
    - "Then we need a deeper hole." Endyln
    - As the players look back to the monster, she's instead been replaced with a pretty middleaged woman with black hair
    - "It's been too long Mother" Endyln (human-form)
    - The old woman continues to smile
    - As the players blink the woman changes once again to a woman just on the cusp of adulthood
    - "How have you been, we've missed you" Endyln
    - "You've made quite the little world for yourself here, I must commend you, it's very impressive for you and your sisters, though I can't help but think that doing so on Prismeer of all places is a slight at your sister." Baba Yaga
    - The woman's face subtly twitches (insight)
    - "Well with its matreon gone.. I simply wanted to ensure its readiness for her return. Say, you got here quick, wanted to see your favorite child? Where is she" Endyln, walks along the house, her nails chewwing a soft gouge in the wood
    - "I suppose whereever you and your sister's hid her?" Baba Yaga
    - "I would never. My heart yurns to see her again just as much as your mother" Endlyn
    - The two hags, standing like mountains over the players stare at eachother for a time
    - "It was a pleasure seeing your darling face Endyln, however, I think it's time for you to leave." Baba Yaga
    - "I know where this is now so I can come visit anytime." Endyln
11. Endyln walks out of the house and the storm raging outside ceases
12. Baba Yaga addresses the small characters addressing them as followed:
    - Yanaba the herrigon
    - Di the soul-seller
    - Karag the heir of twilight
    - Sevro, the theif king
13. She introduces herself as Baba Yaga.
    - She is willing to tell them about:
        - Zalbina 
            - who she is, where she came from
            - Why she is a favorite of hers
            - If kept friendly she will let them know about her suspicion that her daughters captured Zalbina and made her disapear somehow
        - Her Daughers
            - Who they are and their titles
            - What each of the ruleover (hither, tither and yon)
            - The Hourglass Coven' dynamics
14. When ready, Baba Yaga will transport them out of the cottage. She will not let them take whatever they want from the cottage, but she can be convinced to give them each one, at least until Zalbina is freed and takes them back.

## Edge of the mists
1. The enchanted forest emerges from the grey fog
2. At the very edge they can make out 3 figures.
3. As they draw close, the party recognize the cloth wrapped figure of Ep (eee-p), Bavlorna's lacky. They also see a very musclar man with a large toy windup screw over his shoulder, and finally a figure in a fine silk tunic and loose pants.
4. The large one rushes them and combat begins
    - 3 turns, he's not looking to kill anyone only test them
5. The 3 creatures will be one of (impressive | content | discontent)
6. The one in the silk tunic will introduce himself as **Gin**, the large one as **Has** and the last as **Ep**. He will explain that they are the children of the Hourglass Coven and then will ask what the parties intentions are with their mothers.
7. Depending on the encounter so far, Gin may offer them a spot helping them.
8. Ep will offer to take the curse from Karag as a show of good faith
9. Gin will conclude by telling them a little about Tither, and what to expect within.
10. A massive black shadow will fly over them and the 3 brothers will become still. Moments later a large, dark purple colored dragon with a third eye will land beside them.
    - "What are you rats plotting?" Calamity (The dragon)
    - "Nothing, just making some new friends" Gin will respond gesturing towards the group
    - The dragon's eyes will interogate the party then turn back to the 3 brothers
    - "I'm watching you." He'll take another look at the party before leaving
11. The brothers won't want to talk furher and instead say
    - "We'll be in touch"
    - Then leaves



## Party rests
1. Give them time to discuss what happened
2. Use Crabclaw as a means to uncover what their plan is and what they want to do going forward

## Ambush
1. The Frog captain will attack Sevro, requesting a 1on1 combat with him


## Tither
1. The party then enters into Tither, the enchanted forest

## Part 1
### The floating isles
**Hook:** TBD
**Reward:** TBD

### Fablerise and the living books
**Hook:** After a strange dream involving a spider of massive size, the party wakes up and realizes that they no longer remember their names. If they inquire around as to why, they will find out the culprit is Yarnspinner in Fablerise. Fablerise is watched over by Yarnspinner's many spider workers, who act as both librarian and guard. Yarnspinner saw the party and found them interesting, their loss of name was unintentional in a way as Yarnspinner begin tweaking some in-progress books he is working on and his actions led to their names being taken. The names have been given to the characters of the books and if the players want them back they will need to go in to the stories to get them back.
**Reward:** TBD

Book 1 - Hansel and Gretel
    - Cas and Yanaba as the kids
Book 2 - Little Red Riding Hood
    - Di as Red
Book 3 - 

### The Witchlight Carnival
[T] What about have the return of the Witchlight Carnival?
    - I really like this idea. It allows for some reuse by me and some "testing how far they've come" for the group.
    - Can reinvest Yanaba to find the Displacer kitten
        - Puts them on a timelimit to attempt to get into the Orphange
        - Provide them a means of turning into kids to get into the Orphange

## Part 2
### Orphange
    - Ran by a Night Hag (Er Able, Kids call her Miss. Able)
        - The children are petrifed of Miss. Able. During the night she stalks the halls and rooms, anyone found out of place disappears and never comes back.
        - Only children are allowed on the grounds (The party will need to figure out a way to turn into children if they want access.)
    - Problems
        1. The children are stuck within the orpanhage and terrfied of Miss. Able. If a plan for escape is offered that is reasonable, they are desperate enough to take it
        2. As the players look around the house for the Toyhouse, they will go through what a normal day wihin is for the children. Brutal expectations, beatings and beratements from Miss. Able. This will lead into a night scene in which Miss. Able will stalk the halls and rooms looking for anyone misbehaving to eat.
### Casino
    - Ran by an Incubus (Mathew, Lust) and Succubus (Brittany, Greed) duo
    - The two are well informed and know about the party before they even walk in. They offer games of chance and any kind of prostitute to their guests.
    - The casino has a magical effect that makes increases their impulsion to sin one way of another (Wisdon check to avoid)
    - The casino offers many prizes, one of those being a large potion of polymorph
        - They could win the prize (all but impossible)
        - Or, they could be offered it in exchange for killing whoever runs the Spa (by the casino owners who are tired of lost customers)
### Spa
    - Ran by a false hydra (3 heads)
    - Anybody who enters the spa while being able to hear the music is effected by the False Hydra.
    - The party is allowed to walk around. Within are many individuals, all of whom have various serious injuries. Though the occupants don't seem to really notice and always have a convenient excuse to how they have it.
    - A party member that interacts with the Spa, from relaxing in the waters to going for a massage are seriously injured (Missing fingers, ears. Chunks of skin and muscle gone in places.) (-5 Hp perm for each injury substained this way)
    - The party needs to find a way to stop hearing the music, once they do they will see the False Hydra slinking around. It attacks when it notices the players can see it.


## Part 3
### The Toyhouse
- The party will need to find the toyhouse if they wish to find Skabatha.

# Goals
- They should know that Yon is a frozen hellscape where nothing lives
- They should know that the bridges that stretch across each Prismeer all lead to Zalbina's old castle
- Those bridges are all guarded by the respective greater witch that the land belongs to
- Yanaba should find out that the unicorn that asked for her help in the beginning is Skabatha's mount
- They should want to get into the Toyhouse

# Reminders
1. The brothers should contact them sometime while they are here and tell them they'd like to meet to discuss a job they have for them
    - They will ask them to steal Skabatha's diary to learn about the Hourglass Coven's next jubilee
2. Karag should be treated differently here, as if he was high-class
3. Chopaign will want information on Di and the parties plans and will suggest he do everything he can to kill the witches
    - He can also incourage them to find Skabatha's lair
4. Toadstools around Thither offer a quick path between locations

# The Floating Isles
## Opening description: the Floating Isles (first sight)

The trees thin into a long, sloping clearing where the canopy breaks like a torn curtain. Cold sunlight pours down in pale shafts, catching in drifting motes of glitter-dust that shouldn’t exist this deep in Thither.

Above you—far above—the sky is *occupied*.

Five rocky islets hang impossibly overhead, circling one another in a slow, patient orbit like lanterns on an unseen current. Each is scarred by habitation: mushroom-towers, thimble-forts, woven bridges, and snapped banners flapping in wind you can’t feel. Waterfalls spill from mossy ledges into open air, shattering into silver mist long before they ever reach the forest.

And through all five islands runs the same brutal truth: a **colossal iron chain**, links the size of cottages, spearing through stone and root and ruin. It groans as the isles drift, metal complaining against rock. The chain descends from the lowest isle in a straight line—anchored into the earth ahead of you like a harpoon driven into the world.

Then the quiet breaks.

A streak of green light snaps across the air between two isles—an illusionary projectile that pops into a shower of glitter. A heartbeat later, a flight of tiny blackthorn arrows answers from the opposite direction. Somewhere above, you hear a voice the size of a thumb scream an order like it’s commanding an army.

The floating isles aren’t a wonder.

They’re a battlefield.

## Getting up there: climbing the chain (setpiece)
The chain is climbable, but it *moves* not like a rope, but like a living thing slowly adjusting its weight.

**How it feels:** cold iron slick with condensation; shallow grooves in each link where something has been dragging across it for a long time (toys? bodies? tools?).

**Suggested approach (quick skill challenge):** 6 successes before 3 failures, DC 13–15 depending on weather/missile fire.
- **Athletics:** haul up, jump link-to-link, cling when it sways.
- **Acrobatics:** traverse the “underside” of a link when a barrage passes.
- **Perception:** spot a safe timing window between volleys.
- **Survival:** read wind shifts and the chain’s sway to avoid being flung.
- **Tools / magic:** pitons, spider climb, feather fall, etc. count as an auto-success or advantage.

**Complications to sprinkle in (pick 1–2):**
- A burst of pixie glamour makes one link look like the next (Dex save or lose progress).
- Atomie shrapnel “pings” off the chain like hail (minor damage unless they take cover inside a link).
- A grig war-jig ripples through the metal; everyone makes a Con save or suffers a level of exhaustion-like fatigue for 10 minutes (disadvantage on the next check only).

---

## Arrival: the central isle (battle underway)
### 0) As they crest the chain (the “oh no” moment)
- A **sprite arrow** thunks into the chain-link beside the ranger’s hand (close miss).
- A **pixie glamour-burst** pops like a flashbang 20 feet ahead (harmless, but disorienting).
- An **atomie launcher** misfires; something metallic skitters past and bites into the stone like a piton.
- A **grig fiddle-note** hits; for a split second everyone’s heartbeat syncs with it.

**Read-aloud beat:** four different tiny voices shout “INTRUDERS!” in four different styles.

### 1) 30 seconds of chaos (give them one round of agency before anyone “recruits”)
Ask: “What do you do—take cover, shout, wave, run, cast?”
- If they **take cover** behind mushroom-trench: advantage on the first social check because they look competent.
- If they **wave and shout**: Pixies respond first (they love an entrance).
- If they **aim weapons**: Sprites respond first (they respect force).
- If they **cast a flashy spell**: Atomies respond first (they want to study/steal it).
- If they **play music** (bard): Grigs respond first (they’ll “answer” musically).

### 2) Recruitment swarm (noncombat “skill scene”)
Within a minute, each faction sends a 2-creature “contact team” onto the central isle. They don’t all arrive at once—use this order to control pacing:

1) **Pixies** arrive first (fast, dramatic).  
2) **Sprites** arrive second (disciplined, bows ready).  
3) **Grigs** arrive third (music precedes them).  
4) **Atomies** arrive last (stopping to adjust a device mid-run).

--- 

Each contact team tries to “claim” the party. Let the PCs talk; if they attack, the scene becomes a skirmish.

**Skill structure (quick):** 3 successes before 2 failures to avoid immediate combat escalation while they decide who to hear out.
- **Persuasion/Deception/Performance (DC 13):** convince a team to hold fire.
- **Intimidation (DC 14):** paladin/barb can cow them, but sprites hate it (later penalty with sprites).
- **Insight (DC 13):** spot what each team *really* values (and tailor response).
- **Nature/Survival (DC 13):** ranger identifies the “safe lane” between firing angles.
- **Arcana (DC 13):** warlock identifies illusion vs real terrain to avoid stumbling into a kill-zone.

On a failure, a volley begins: each PC makes a DC 13 Dex save or takes **1d6** damage (tiny battlefield chip damage). Keep it tense, not lethal.

---


When the chain finally pulls you level with the **middle isle**, you don’t climb onto a settlement, you climb onto **no-man’s-land**.

The central rock is cratered and raw, carpeted in smashed toadstools and scorched flowers. Broken toys lie everywhere like bones—splintered soldiers, snapped dolls, a tiny tea set melted into the stone. Crude barricades made of spool-wood and mushroom stalks form short “trenches,” constantly abandoned and retaken.

Four different colors of presence press in from four directions:
- disciplined **sprite** lines, bark-shielded and arrow-ready,
- shimmering **pixie** bursts, all light and laughter and knives behind smiles,
- buzzing **atomie** gadgets that whine and spark and occasionally explode,
- and skittering **grig** skirmishers whose music makes the ground itself feel unsteady.

As you crest the chain onto the rock, a near-miss arrow thunks into the chain link beside your head.

Up ahead, something tiny screams: “NEW COMBATANTS!”

All four sides notice you at once.

# The Four Camps (outer isles)

## The Central Isle Map in 5 Simple Zones (easy to run)
1) **Chain Crest:** exposed, dangerous, easiest to get knocked off (nonlethal if you want: they catch a lower link).  
2) **Mushroom Trenches:** half cover, lots of broken toys.  
3) **The Rune-Knot:** where the chain pierces stone—this is where “break the chain” happens.  
4) **No-Man’s Orchard:** smashed flowers + sticky sap = difficult terrain in patches.  
5) **Banner Spire Ruins:** broken flagpole cluster—perfect “parley spot” if they demand talks.

Each outer isle is a faction camp. They’re close enough that you can see and hear the others—close enough that hatred doesn’t have time to cool.

Below are: **camp description**, **two notable individuals** (with quirks), and **what the King demands** if the party allies with them.

---

## Sprite Camp — Thistledart’s Thorn-Host
**Look & feel:** a severe, military outpost built from blackthorn, bark shields, and leaf-scale armor. Everything is measured: straight lines, drilled lanes, sentry perches. Their banners are angular and clean, like someone tried to make a flag out of an order.

**Defenses:** “arrow slits” carved into living wood, tripwires made from spider-silk, and a kill-zone facing the central isle.

### Two Sprite NPCs
1) **Captain Needlewick** (sprite officer)  
   - **Quirk:** cannot speak without using battlefield jargon (“flank,” “advance,” “morale”), even in casual conversation.  
   - **Use:** will respect PCs who keep promises; can provide safe approach routes and signals.

2) **Quartermaster Brine** (sprite logistician)  
   - **Quirk:** obsessed with inventory; tags everything, including PC weapons, with tiny paper labels.  
   - **Use:** knows where stolen supplies are going (great for non-lethal sabotage missions).

### Thistledart’s instructions (to “destroy the other fairies”)
Thistledart treats the PCs like a special operations unit. He wants:
- **Pixies:** destroy their glamour cache (their illusion “ammunition”), burn the pollen sacks in their mushroom towers.  
- **Atomies:** sabotage their launcher rig so it misfires *on them*.  
- **Grigs:** silence the “war-fiddle” that keeps morale high (break the instrument or steal it).

He frames this as restoring “order” and “ending chaos.”

---

## Pixie Camp — Glimmersip’s Revel-Redoubt
**Look & feel:** a riotous, theatrical village of mushroom towers, petal-cloaks strung like curtains, and lanterns that change color based on the mood of whoever looks at them. The air tastes like sugar and rain, and the ground is covered in glitter that is definitely tracking you.

**Defenses:** illusions everywhere: false doors, fake cliffs, decoy sentries, and “harmless” pranks that become lethal when you’re distracted.

### Two Pixie NPCs
1) **Duchess Winkwhorl** (pixie illusionist)  
   - **Quirk:** speaks only in compliments and insults, no neutral statements.  
   - **Use:** can offer disguises/illusions for infiltration; she’s also dangerously perceptive.

2) **Sir Tafflepop** (pixie duelist)  
   - **Quirk:** refuses to fight unless it’s “dramatically appropriate” (will pause combat to reposition for lighting / entrance).  
   - **Use:** loves wagers; can be baited into leaving a post if challenged correctly.

### Glimmersip’s instructions
Glimmersip wants the war “won” through humiliation and collapse:
- **Sprites:** steal their banner and replace it with a ridiculous counterfeit (shatters discipline).  
- **Atomies:** steal one critical component (a spring-coil “heart”) from their main device, let their own machines fail at the worst time.  
- **Grigs:** poison their audience, turn their next performance into silence by scattering “dull-dust” on their stage.

He sells it as “ending the misery with style.”

---

## Atomie Camp — Brasswhistle’s Thimbleworks
**Look & feel:** a patchwork thimble-fort and workshop city, all scavenged metal, acorn-cap helmets, tiny cranes, and humming rigs. Everything is strapped together with wire and optimism. The whole camp vibrates faintly like a wind-up toy.

**Defenses:** traps. Not all of them intentional. You’ll see “WARNING” signs written after the trap was already placed.

### Two Atomie NPCs
1) **Adjunct Sprocket** (atomie engineer)  
   - **Quirk:** cannot stop improving things; will try to “upgrade” a PC’s gear without asking.  
   - **Use:** can build a device to help break the chain… if given time and materials.

2) **Scout Kettleclick** (atomie runner)  
   - **Quirk:** speaks so fast most of it becomes static; pauses only when offered tea.  
   - **Use:** knows the latest movements of all factions (and which routes aren’t watched).

### Brasswhistle’s instructions
Brasswhistle wants decisive, mechanical dominance:
- **Sprites:** disable their perimeter traps and remove their “range advantage” (destroy arrow perches / signal horns).  
- **Pixies:** capture a live pixie “glamour source” (pollen, lantern-heart, or an illusion focus) for study.  
- **Grigs:** destroy their bridge supports so their hit-and-run skirmishers can’t reach the middle.

He frames it as “optimizing survival outcomes.”

---

## Grig Camp — Fiddlebriar’s Briar-Stage
**Look & feel:** woven rope-bridges and living vine-walkways connecting platforms like a traveling festival that set up in a hurry and never left. The air is full of music—even when no one is playing, your heartbeat feels slightly off-tempo.

**Defenses:** morale warfare: songs that stir courage, dread, sleepiness, or rage. Also: embarrassing traps. A surprising number of things dump you into mud.

### Two Grig NPCs
1) **Cord-Mother Jangle** (grig stage-builder)  
   - **Quirk:** refuses to speak without plucking a string between words; punctuation is music.  
   - **Use:** can rig bridges for stealth approaches or sudden collapses.

2) **Piper Soursong** (grig morale-officer)  
   - **Quirk:** can’t tell a lie, but will absolutely mislead with *technically true* statements.  
   - **Use:** knows who’s faking bravery and who’s about to break.

### Fiddlebriar’s instructions
Fiddlebriar wants the others broken in spirit:
- **Sprites:** get their captain publicly embarrassed (steal orders, forge contradictory commands, make them look foolish).  
- **Pixies:** smash their “laugh-lanterns” that keep their camp buoyant and fearless.  
- **Atomies:** steal their newest invention and debut it on stage as a joke—then break it in front of them.

He sells it as “ending the war by making it too stupid to continue.”

# The Kings’ pitch (how they approach the party)
Whichever camp the PCs talk to first, that king will:
1) insist the PCs are **clearly destiny / reinforcements**, and  
2) offer a “quick alliance,” and  
3) give orders to cripple the other three factions.

**Important:** each king’s plan is intentionally biased and escalatory. None of them are “lying” about being wronged, but all of them omit their own worst actions.

---

# Endings you want (and how to make them playable)

## Ending 1: Help one king seize ownership
If the PCs destroy/neutralize the other camps, the remaining king claims the central isle and “command” of the chain network. The war ends because there’s no one left to fight.

**Practical structure:**
- Each faction has **2–3 “war assets”** (banner, device, morale focus, supply cache).  
- Taking out a faction means removing **two assets** (not necessarily murdering everyone).

This keeps it doable and lets PCs choose sabotage over slaughter.

## Ending 2: Break the chains and save them all
To make “break the chain” feel like a real alternative (not just a cute idea), give the chain **four lock-sigils**—one controlled by each camp. Each king either:
- carries a **key-sigil**, or  
- has it installed in a camp relic (banner pole, lantern-heart, war-fiddle, spring-core).

**To break the chain, the party must obtain all four sigils** and use them at the central isle where the chain pierces the rock (a visible “knot” of runes and iron).

**Resolution method (choose one):**
- **Skill ritual:** Arcana/Religion/Tools checks to “desynchronize” the locks while under fire.  
- **Physical destruction:** each sigil removed weakens the chain; final break requires a big hit + cleverness (or a placed atomie device, or grig resonance, etc.).  
- **Diplomacy:** convince camps to surrender their sigils voluntarily (hard, but possible if PCs expose Skabatha’s manipulation, show shared suffering, or stage a ceasefire).

When the chain breaks, the outer isles drift apart—distance returns, and the war becomes impossible to maintain.

---

# “Medium” rewards (one per faction; saving all = get all four)
Designed to feel meaningful at level 4 without breaking your campaign.

## Sprite reward: **Thistledart’s Oath-Token**
A thorn-silver badge pinned to clothing.
- **Benefit:** Once per long rest, when you roll initiative, you can add **+1d4** to your initiative roll *and* one ally within 30 ft gains the same bonus.

## Pixie reward: **Glimmersip’s Pollen of Make-Believe**
A crystal vial of shimmering powder (3 pinches).
- **Benefit:** As an action, sprinkle one pinch to cast **disguise self** (save DC 13 to disbelieve) or grant **advantage on one Deception or Performance check** (your choice) within 10 minutes.

## Atomie reward: **Brasswhistle’s Chain-Cracker**
A palm-sized spring-driven clamp with a winding key.
- **Benefit:** Once per long rest, you can deploy it as an action to cast **enlarge/reduce** (*reduce only*, DC 13) on a nonmagical object you can touch (great for shrinking bars/locks/gear).  
- Also counts as **thieves’ tools** for one check (it has picks built in).

## Grig reward: **Fiddlebriar’s Battle-String**
A braided vine-string that hums softly when danger is near.
- **Benefit:** Once per long rest, as a bonus action, you can grant one creature within 30 ft **1d6** (bardic-inspiration-style) usable on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within 10 minutes.


### First 10 minutes on the Central Isle (battle-in-progress “arrival script”)
This is tuned to your party (bard / paladin-barb / ranger / warlock): lots of chances to talk, flex social leverage, and still feel threatened.

5) **Banner Spire Ruins:** broken flagpole cluster—perfect “parley spot” if they demand talks.

---

# Faction “War Assets” (trackable objectives)
To support your two endings cleanly, give each faction **3 assets**. Neutralize **2 assets** to “remove them from the war” (route them, not necessarily massacre them).

Also: each faction controls **one Chain Lock-Sigil** needed to break the chain.

### Sprites (Order)
- **Asset S1: The Blackthorn Banner** (morale + authority)  
- **Asset S2: Arrow Perches** (range advantage into central isle)  
- **Asset S3: The Oath-Ledger** (names + vows written in thorn-ink)

**Chain Sigil:** pressed into the banner pole’s iron cap.

**How PCs might handle it:**
- Ranger can ghost through perches; bard can fake a command; paladin/barb can duel a captain; warlock can charm a sentry.

### Pixies (Glamour)
- **Asset P1: Laugh-Lanterns** (fear immunity / morale field)  
- **Asset P2: Pollen Cache** (illusion “ammo”)  
- **Asset P3: Mirror Door** (teleport trick between towers)

**Chain Sigil:** hidden inside the largest Laugh-Lantern (a glass “heart”).

### Atomies (Invention)
- **Asset A1: The Misfire Launcher** (bombards central isle)  
- **Asset A2: The Spring-Core Generator** (powers traps + gadgets)  
- **Asset A3: The Tool-King’s Loupe** (lets them spot invisible/illusion weak points)

**Chain Sigil:** attached to the spring-core like a safety lock.

### Grigs (Morale Warfare)
- **Asset G1: The War-Fiddle** (battle-song effect)  
- **Asset G2: Vine Bridges** (mobility + raids)  
- **Asset G3: The Songbook of Sharp Jests** (curses-as-ballads)

**Chain Sigil:** sewn into the War-Fiddle’s strap (invisible unless you know what to look for).

---

# “Break the Chain” Ritual (party-friendly, spotlighting classes)
At the **Rune-Knot** on the central isle: four slots accept the four sigils. Once inserted, the knot fights back—iron groans, runes flare, the chain tries to “reassert” itself.

Run it as **4 rounds**. Each round, one PC must spend an action to contribute. Need **6 total successes** before **3 failures**.

Good contributions (suggested DCs):
- **Paladin/Barb:** Athletics DC 14 to physically hold the chain steady / wedge a link  
- **Warlock:** Arcana DC 14 to disrupt the binding runes (or use an appropriate spell for auto-success)  
- **Bard:** Performance/Persuasion DC 13 to “conduct” the emotional resonance—this is Fey magic, emotion matters  
- **Ranger:** Survival/Perception DC 13 to call timing between volleys / spot rune-pattern changes

**Battlefield pressure:** each round, choose one complication:
- Pixie flash (Dex save DC 13 or disadvantage on that round’s check)
- Sprite arrows (take cover or 1d6 damage)
- Atomie shrapnel (Con save DC 13 or -10 ft speed for a round)
- Grig dissonance (Wis save DC 13 or cannot take reactions this round)

On success: chain snaps, outer isles drift apart, the war *physically cannot continue*.

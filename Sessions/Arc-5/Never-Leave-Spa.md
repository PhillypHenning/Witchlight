# Never Leave Spa and Hotsprings

## Overview

"Never Leave" announces itself long before its shape appears in the trees. A strange, discordant music drifts through the forest—half lullaby, half funeral march—that raises gooseflesh and a crawling unease along the spine. Follow the sound and you find what looks, at first glance, almost respectable: a low complex of marble walls beaded with condensation, thick fogged-glass windows glowing warmly from within, and chimneys puffing steady coils of scented steam into the air. Lanterns flicker invitingly by the door, and a carved sign promises rest, relaxation, and the best baths in all of Thither.

Inside, the steam turns thick and grey, clinging to the skin and swallowing shapes after only a few steps. Shadows of attendants move gracefully through the mist, offering towels, oils, and soothing words in voices that never quite match the mouths you glimpse. Somewhere deeper in, the music continues—one wavering, endless song that drowns out questions, doubts, and…other screams.

**Creature:** False Hydra (3 heads)
**Danger Level:** Deadly
**Hook:** Party might hear about the spa from other locations, or be offered polymorph potion by the casino owners in exchange for killing whoever runs it

## The Trap

The Never Leave Spa is a death trap masquerading as luxury. A False Hydra with three heads has claimed this location, using its haunting song to keep victims docile and unaware as it feeds on them slowly over time. The creature moves between rooms through the thick mist, its long serpentine necks reaching out to bite, tear, and feed while its song ensures no one remembers seeing it, hearing screams, or feeling more than a vague unease.

Guests remember only pleasant sensations—warm water, skilled hands, soothing words—while their bodies accumulate horrific injuries they cannot explain.

## Layout

### Entrance Hall
Marble floors slick with condensation. A reception desk sits empty, though towels and robes are neatly folded and waiting. The song is audible but distant. Light steam drifts through. A guest book lies open, names slowly dissolving into the wet pages.

### Main Bath Chamber
A large pool of mineral-hot water occupies most of this room. Thick fog rolls across the surface. Stone benches line the walls. Shadowy figures move through the mist, gesturing welcomingly. The song echoes beautifully off the marble walls here.

**If hearing the song:** The attendants guide you into the warm water. It feels incredible. Everything becomes soft and distant...

**If protected from song:** The "attendants" are revealed as long, pale, eyeless heads on serpentine necks withdrawing into the fog. The water is tinged pink.

### Massage Chambers (3 rooms)
Private rooms with low tables, scented oils, and thick steam. Each has a drain in the floor dark with old blood. The mist is especially thick here.

**If hearing the song:** Skilled hands work tension from your muscles. You hear crunching sounds. Your face is wet. Are those tears? You don't know why you're crying. (See Mechanics below)

**If protected from song:** Blood-slicked tables. Piles of torn cloth. Something large moves through the mist above you.

### Steam Room
The source of the pervasive fog. Large brass pipes pump steam from underground hot springs. The heat here is nearly unbearable. Through the fog, massive coils can sometimes be glimpsed winding between the pipes.

**Important:** Destroying or shutting off these pipes will clear the mist over the course of 1d4 rounds, making the False Hydra fully visible and removing its combat advantages.

### Private Pools (4 small chambers)
Individual bathing areas with copper tubs. Several contain "guests" - see NPCs below.

---

## NPCs - The Guests

If the party enters **without hearing protection**, they see relaxed, dreamy-eyed guests in various states of repose, all sporting terrible injuries they seem not to notice:

### The Satisfied Guests

**Margery Plumwood** (Halfling woman, missing three fingers on her left hand)
- Soaking in a private pool, humming along with the song
- "Oh this? Gardening accident. I've always been clumsy with shears."
- Completely content, will defend the spa if players cause trouble
- **If hearing stopped:** Begins screaming, clutching her hand in agony

**Thom Ashwick** (Human man, missing his left ear and chunks of his shoulder)
- Receiving a "massage" (actually being slowly eaten)
- "The attendants here are miracle workers! I feel so relaxed!"
- His face is wet with tears he doesn't acknowledge
- **If hearing stopped:** Convulses in pain, tries to flee

**Brindel & Cor** (Gnome couple, each missing toes, fingers, and having deep gouges in their backs)
- In the main bath together, holding hands
- "We've been coming here for weeks! Best honeymoon ever!"
- Neither remembers arriving or notices time passing
- **If hearing stopped:** Both collapse, crying out for help

**Velvet** (Eladrin, missing her nose and large patches of scalp)
- Wandering the halls in a daze, smiling vacantly
- "The attendants say I'm getting more beautiful every day..."
- Longest-term "guest" - has been here for months
- **If hearing stopped:** Goes catatonic with shock

### In Combat
- Guests under the song's effect will not interfere unless players harm them
- Guests freed from the song will flee immediately (if able) or cower
- The False Hydra can use its action to **Feed** on a guest within reach, dealing 2d10 damage to them and regaining half that amount as HP
- Conscious guests can be convinced to move/flee with successful DC 12 Persuasion checks

## The False Hydra

A creature of pale, fleshy coils and three eyeless heads with mouths full of razor teeth. Its body remains mostly underground, with its three long necks emerging through the steam to hunt. Each head moves independently, and all three sing in harmony—a sound that rewrites memory and drowns out reality.

### Stats
Use **False Hydra** stats (CR 8-10 depending on party level):
- **3 Heads:** Each can attack independently
- **Multiattack:** The hydra makes three bite attacks
- **Bite:** +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., 2d8+4 piercing damage
- **Song of Forgetting:** Any creature that can hear the hydra's song must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or forget the hydra exists. They cannot target it with attacks, spells, or abilities. The save can be repeated at the end of each turn when the creature takes damage. Deafened creatures are immune.
- **Burrow:** The hydra can burrow through the ground, retreating underground as part of its movement
- **HP:** ~150 (adjust as needed)

### Combat Tactics
- **In Mist:** The hydra has full mobility. Ranged attack rolls against it have disadvantage. It moves between rooms freely, attacking then burrowing back underground.
- **Out of Mist:** Once the steam pipes are destroyed/shut off (1d4 rounds to fully clear), the hydra is fully visible and loses its mist advantages. It becomes more aggressive.
- **Regeneration:** Can use an action to **Feed** on a helpless NPC within reach (2d10 damage to NPC, regain half as HP)
- **Retreating Heads:** After attacking, heads withdraw underground, making opportunity attacks difficult

### If Heads are Destroyed
- Each head has 50 HP worth of the total
- Destroying a head stops one-third of the song (makes saves easier: DC 15 with 2 heads, DC 14 with 1 head)
- Destroying all three heads kills the hydra and stops the song entirely

## Encounter Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Entering Without Hearing Protection

The party hears the beautiful, haunting song and enters the spa normally.

**Experience:**
- Everything feels dream-like and pleasant
- Shadowy attendants greet them warmly, offer robes and towels
- They're guided to baths, massage tables, or steam rooms
- The experience feels wonderful, relaxing, perfect
- But... there's a crunching sound. Tearing. Wet sounds.
- They realize their faces are wet. Tears? Why are they crying?
- Everything remains hazy and wonderful despite the wrongness

**Mechanics:**
Each player experiencing a spa "service" must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw:
- **Failure:** They submit to the treatment, taking **1d10+5 damage** as the False Hydra feeds on them. They forget this happened but retain the injury and pain.
- **Max Damage (15):** The character loses a **minor extremity** (finger, toe, ear, nose, patch of scalp - player/DM choice). Permanent injury until magically restored.
- **Success:** They snap out of it momentarily, realizing something is very wrong. They can attempt to flee or take action.

The party can attempt to leave at any time, though they'll feel an strange reluctance. Once outside and out of earshot, they'll start to remember pieces of what happened and notice their injuries.

### Scenario 2: Entering With Hearing Protection

The party deafens themselves (earplugs, Silence spell, self-inflicted deafness) before entering.

**Experience:**
- The mist is still thick, but something is terribly wrong
- NPCs are **screaming in agony**, clutching their injuries
- Shadowy "attendants" are revealed as pale, eyeless heads on long necks retreating into the fog
- Blood in the water, on the tables, trailing between rooms
- The False Hydra is aware the party is immune and begins hunting actively

**Mechanics:**
- Party can see evidence of the creature but not the full body (mist concealment)
- They need to find and destroy/shut off the steam pipes to clear the mist
- Steam pipes: AC 15, 20 HP each, immunity to poison/psychic, can be shut off with DC 15 Investigation or Thieves' Tools check
- Once pipes are destroyed: 1d4 rounds until mist clears enough to see the hydra fully
- NPCs who can hear the song remain docile; NPCs who cannot hear scream and flee

### Scenario 3: Stopping the Song Mid-Visit

If the party enters normally but then breaks the song's effect (killing heads, Silence spell, etc.):

**Experience:**
- Reality snaps back like a broken bone
- The pleasant warmth becomes burning pain
- They see their injuries for the first time
- NPCs around them begin screaming
- The creature is revealed, angry and hungry

**Mechanics:**
- All party members immediately become aware of their injuries and damage taken
- NPCs panic - some flee, some go into shock
- Combat begins with the False Hydra surprised for one round (it's not used to prey remembering)
- Mist still provides concealment until pipes are dealt with

---

## Stopping the Music

Multiple solutions work:

**Deafen the Party:**
- Wax earplugs (if they have them)
- *Silence* spell (must be maintained or moved with the caster)
- Self-inflicted deafness (temporary or magical)

**Destroy the Source:**
- Kill all three heads (stops the song permanently)
- *Silence* spell cast on the creature itself

**Resist the Effect:**
- *Mind Blank* or similar high-level protection
- Successful repeated Wisdom saves (difficult but possible)

---

## Stopping the Mist

The thick fog gives the False Hydra major advantages in combat. To clear it:

**Destroy the Steam Pipes:**
- Located in the Steam Room and under floor grates throughout
- **AC 15, 20 HP each** (4-5 pipes total)
- Immunity to poison and psychic damage
- Can be attacked or sabotaged

**Shut Off the Pipes:**
- **DC 15 Investigation** to find the shut-off valve (hidden behind loose marble panel in Steam Room)
- **DC 15 Thieves' Tools** or appropriate tool check to shut it down
- Takes 1 action

**Magical Solutions:**
- *Gust of Wind* or similar magic can clear small areas temporarily (1 round)
- *Control Weather* or similar powerful magic can clear the entire building

**Once Stopped:**
- Mist clears over **1d4 rounds**
- Each round, visibility improves by 15 feet
- False Hydra loses its concealment advantage
- Ranged attacks no longer have disadvantage

---

## Treasure

If the party defeats the False Hydra and searches the spa:

### In the Reception Area
- **Guest Lockbox:** 450 gp, various jewelry worth 300 gp total (belonged to eaten guests)
- **Ledger:** Names of dozens of visitors, many crossed out. Some recognizable names from other Thither locations.

### In the Steam Room (hidden under pipes)
- **False Hydra's Hoard:**
  - 1,200 gp
  - *Ring of Mind Shielding*
  - *Potion of Greater Healing* (x3)
  - *Oil of Etherealness*
  - A small music box that plays the hydra's song when opened (can be used to affect one creature, DC 14 Wisdom save)

### In Private Chambers
- Various personal effects from victims
- *Sending Stones* (pair) - belonged to separated lovers, one of whom never made it here

### If Players Search the Basement
- The hydra's true nest: bones, more treasure (DM's choice)
- **Fey-Touched Map:** A partial map of Thither showing Fablerise, the Casino, and a strange symbol where the Toyhouse might be (doesn't reveal exact location but narrows search)
- **Skabatha's Calling Card:** An ornate wooden card with a toymaker's mark. On the back: "For services rendered in pest control. - S.N." (This hydra was deliberately introduced here by Skabatha to eliminate rivals and unwanted visitors)

---

## Aftermath

### If Guests Survive
- They're traumatized but grateful
- Most will flee Thither entirely if given the chance
- Velvet (the Eladrin) is too far gone mentally and may need greater restoration or similar magic
- Word spreads that the party destroyed the "spa" - reaction depends on who hears it

### If Casino Owners Learn of Success
- If the party was offered the polymorph potion deal, the casino owners make good on their promise
- If not, they might approach the party with other "opportunities"

### The Building
- With the hydra dead, the spa is just a building
- Hot springs still work - could be genuinely useful if party needs to rest
- Locals might eventually reclaim it, or it could become a safe haven for the party

---

## DM Notes

### Pacing
- This encounter works best if players don't immediately realize the danger
- Let them experience some "spa treatments" before revealing the horror
- Build tension with sensory details: the wrong sounds, the tears, the wrongness beneath the pleasure

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Easier:** Reduce False Hydra HP, lower save DCs, make pipe destruction easier
- **Harder:** Add more heads (5 instead of 3), increase HP, make mist harder to clear
- Consider party level: CR 8-10 is appropriate for parties around level 7-9

### Foreshadowing
- Other NPCs in Thither might mention the spa with dreamy, uncertain expressions
- "I went there once... I think? I can't quite remember..."
- A previous spa visitor might be missing fingers/toes but have no explanation

### Moral Weight
- Saving the NPCs should feel important and difficult
- Players might need to choose between tactical advantages and protecting victims
- The False Hydra eating NPCs to heal creates horrible choices in combat

### Connection to Skabatha
- The calling card reveals Skabatha knows about this place
- She may have deliberately seeded this monster here to control Thither's population
- Could be a way for players to earn her interest (or ire) depending on their actions

## Random Encounter Connection

If this location is discovered through random encounter, consider:

**The Referral:** 
A charming satyr (actually in thrall to the song from a previous visit) enthusiastically recommends the spa. "Best place in all Thither! You simply *must* go. In fact, I'll take you there myself!" He genuinely believes this and remembers nothing wrong.

**The Warning:**
The ghost children know something is wrong at "the singing place" but can't articulate what. They avoid it instinctively. "The nice people who went there... they came back different. Crying when they smiled."

**The Survivor:**
One of Skabatha's orphans escaped and hid in the spa, thinking it was safe. They're currently under the song's effect but injured. Finding them creates time pressure for rescue.

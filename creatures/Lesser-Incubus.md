## Traits

**Shapechanger.** The lesser incubus can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, it loses its flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Telepathic Bond (Limited).** The lesser incubus can communicate telepathically with a creature it has charmed within 30 feet, ignoring the normal range restriction while within that distance.

## Actions

**Claw (Fiend Form Only).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Charm.** One humanoid the lesser incubus can see within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 hour. The charmed target obeys the lesser incubus's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a dangerous command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this lesser incubus's Charm for the next 24 hours. The lesser incubus can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.

**Draining Kiss.** The lesser incubus kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

## Roleplaying Notes

Lesser incubi are younger or less powerful versions of their full-strength counterparts. They typically serve in establishments like casinos or pleasure houses, using their charm and allure to encourage spending and gather information. While dangerous, they're more interested in manipulation and seduction than outright combat.

**Personality:** Flirtatious, playful, genuinely enjoy their work  
**Tactics:** Charm first, flee if threatened, only fight if cornered  
**Weaknesses:** Overconfident, can be distracted by flattery, bound by their employment contracts

**Casino Role:** Escorts and floor workers who encourage guests to stay longer and spend more. They provide companionship, entertainment, and subtle psychological manipulation to keep patrons gambling.
